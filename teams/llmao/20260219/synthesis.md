# PART A — SYNTHESIS

## Core Insight

The interviews are not fundamentally about dating.

They are about:

> Reducing the psychological risk of entering unfamiliar social environments during transition moments.

Across interviews, several structural themes emerge.

---

## 1️⃣ The Real Barrier = Social Uncertainty Before Arrival

Participants repeatedly expressed:
- Feeling weird walking into unknown events  
- Wanting chat before meeting  
- Wanting screening  
- Wanting someone to walk them home  
- Preferring group sizes strategically  

The core anxiety is not rejection.  
It is **walking into an undefined social dynamic**.

This reframes the product from:

**“Activity-based dating”**

To:

**“Structured, predictable entry into social spaces.”**

---

## 2️⃣ Group Size Is a Risk Strategy

Small groups and large groups are not personality markers.

They function as coping mechanisms:

- **Small groups** → depth + control + predictability  
- **Large groups** → statistical probability + social camouflage  

Group size becomes an anxiety calibration tool.

This is a core design lever.

---

## 3️⃣ Transition Moments Drive Demand

High-signal interviews involve:
- Moving cities  
- Losing friend groups  
- Cultural relocation  
- Post-breakup reset  
- Social isolation  

This is a **life transition infrastructure** problem.

The product is strongest when someone thinks:

> “I don’t know enough people here.”

---

## 4️⃣ Safety Is Both Physical and Psychological

Safety appeared explicitly (walk home, screening).

But deeper safety themes include:
- Pre-event transparency  
- Knowing who’s coming  
- Knowing what vibe to expect  
- Avoiding awkward 1-on-1 exposure  

Safety = emotional predictability.

---

## 5️⃣ Branding Risk

“Post-breakup” positioning creates polarization.

It may:
- Attract emotionally vulnerable users  
- Repel stable, high-intent users  

This creates potential marketplace quality issues.

---

## 6️⃣ Competition Is Not Just Dating Apps

Current substitutes include:
- WhatsApp groups  
- School clubs  
- Institutional programming  
- Eventbrite / Luma  
- Dating apps used for venue discovery  

The product must outperform:

> “Text the group chat.”

---

## Synthesis Statement

This is not primarily a dating product.

It is:

> A structured, activity-based system for socially integrating into new environments with emotional predictability.

# PART B — REFLECTION QUESTIONS

## 1️⃣ What did the AI find that the team missed?

- The central friction is uncertainty before arrival, not romance.
- Group size functions as anxiety management.
- City integration is a macro-theme.
- Institutional substitutes are serious early competition.
- Breakup branding carries marketplace adverse selection risk.
- Compassion-based matching could be a positioning wedge, not just a feature.

---

## 2️⃣ What did the team notice that the AI didn’t?

- Emotional intensity scoring (6/10 vs 10/10 urgency).
- Clear signal classification (Green / Yellow / Red).
- Repeated concrete safety needs (walk home).
- Contradictions within individuals (e.g., wanting large groups but only 1–2 real connections).

The team captured strong behavioral detail and operational insights.

---

## 3️⃣ Where did the team trust the AI’s read? Where didn’t they?

### Trusted:
- Anxiety framing  
- Pre-event transparency as core lever  
- Network risk from rebound branding  
- Competition from institutional systems  

### Less Certain:
- Compassion-based matching as scalable differentiator  
- City-integration framing beyond a campus-heavy sample  
- Over-psychologizing group size preferences  

---

## Final Meta-Observation

The team captured concrete patterns well.

The AI contributed structural abstraction and marketplace risk analysis.

Together, they create a more complete synthesis.
