## The Problem

People in transition moments (moving cities, post-breakup, starting a new program, losing a friend group) struggle to enter new social environments safely and comfortably.

Interviewees described:

- “Feels weird at events where you go to a new event and don’t know anything about anyone.”
- “Never used dating apps — feels like online shopping for people.”
- “Needs someone to walk her home.”
- “Has no more friends left.”

The problem is not a lack of events.  
It’s the anxiety of walking into unfamiliar social spaces.

### Who has this problem?

- Students and young professionals (22–30)
- Recently moved to a new city
- Recently went through a breakup
- Lost their existing friend group
- International or culturally relocating

### How do they currently deal with it?

- WhatsApp college groups
- Mutual friends
- School resources
- Eventbrite / Luma
- Dating apps (sometimes just to find restaurants or venues)
- Avoiding events entirely

### How painful is it?

Moderate to severe.

- One interviewee expressed 10/10 urgency (“Has no more friends left.”)
- Multiple expressed safety concerns.
- Several explicitly avoid dating apps despite wanting connection.

This is an emotionally loaded problem.

## The Solution

We are building an activity-based social matching platform that helps people enter new social spaces with predictability and safety.

The product:

- Matches users into curated activity-based events (yoga, museums, sports, board games, music, etc.)
- Allows pre-event transparency and communication
- Lets users choose preferred group size (small or large)
- Prioritizes emotional safety and low-pressure interaction

Unlike dating apps, this is not swipe-based or attraction-first.  
Unlike event platforms, this is not anonymous and unstructured.

It combines activity + structure + social predictability.

## Target User

### Demographics

- 22–30 years old
- Students or early-career professionals
- Urban (e.g., NYC)
- In transition (new city, breakup, new program)

### Defining Behavior

- Actively trying to “put themselves out there”
- Searching for events or venues on Instagram or apps
- Using WhatsApp or institutional groups for social connection
- Avoiding dating apps due to distrust or discomfort

### How They Describe the Problem

- “Feels weird walking into events alone.”

## Why Now

- Increased relocation for education and work
- Urban loneliness rising among young adults
- Dating apps have become transactional and polarized
- People are seeking lower-pressure, interest-based interaction
- Technology makes structured group coordination easy

The cultural moment favors activity-based connection over pure dating.

## Key Interview Evidence

**Strongest Quote:**  
“Never used dating apps — feels like online shopping for people.”

**Pattern:**  
Activity-based events (yoga, museums, sports, board games) were preferred over clubs/bars across multiple interviews.

**Surprise:**  
Some users use dating apps to discover venues or events, not primarily for dating.

**Current Spend/Effort:**  

- Paying for classes (pilates, yoga, museums)
- Using Eventbrite / Luma
- Spending time coordinating in group chats
- Emotional cost of isolation

2. How much do users actually value pre-event chat and transparency?
3. What is the optimal group size structure for different anxiety levels?
4. Would users pay, or is this a free coordination tool?
5. How do we solve safety without creating friction?
