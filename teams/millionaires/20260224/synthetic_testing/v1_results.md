## Key Findings

### ✅ What Resonated

**1. The "game" framing (8/10 loved it)**
> "I love the idea of my city being a game board. That's such a fresh way to think about exploring."  
— Sarah

> "The badge and achievement system would totally get me hooked. I'm competitive like that."  
— Jordan

**2. Solving real pain point (9/10 related)**
> "This is EXACTLY my problem. We literally go to the same 3 restaurants every weekend."  
— Alex

> "The 'tired of doing the same things' section hit home. That's me every Friday night."  
— Lisa

**3. Social/couples angle (7/10 liked)**
> "I love that this is designed for couples. Most apps feel like solo activities."  
— Emma

---

### ⚠️ What Confused People

**1. "Is this just a list app with gamification?" (6/10 asked this)**
> "I'm not totally clear how this is different from just using Google Maps with a checklist. What makes it special?"  
— Carlos

> "So it's like Yelp but with points? I need to understand the core experience better."  
— Marcus

**2. Pricing concerns (4/10 mentioned)**
> "No mention of cost. Is this free? Freemium? Subscription? I'd want to know upfront."  
— Priya

**3. "10,000+ explorers" claim feels unverifiable (3/10 skeptical)**
> "You're on a waitlist page but claim 10,000 users? That doesn't add up."  
— Kevin

---

### ❌ What Turned People Off

**1. Too much text (5/10 said this)**
> "The objection handling section is good but it's A LOT. I started skimming by the end."  
— Maya

> "TLDR please. I want to get the gist in 10 seconds, not read an essay."  
— Jordan

**2. Generic testimonials (4/10 found them unconvincing)**
> "These quotes feel made up. Are these real people? Show me proof."  
— Carlos

**3. Weak initial hook (3/10)**
> "The headline is okay but didn't make me go 'wow.' Felt a bit generic."  
— Priya

## Specific Feedback by Section

### Hero
- **Headline "Your City Is an Adventure Game"** → Mixed (6/10 liked, 4/10 wanted something more direct/benefit-focused)
- **CTA "Join the Waitlist"** → Good, clear

### How It Works
- Too wordy, users want visuals or simpler steps
- "Level Up Your Weekends" title resonated strongly

### Problem/Solution
- Problem description resonated with almost everyone
- Solution still felt vague ("personalized quests" needs concrete examples)

### Social Proof
- Testimonials felt inauthentic without names, photos, or verification
- "10,000+ explorers" number questioned when there's a waitlist

### Objection Handling
- Good content, but too long
- Condensing to 2-3 objections would improve readability

### CTA
- Form asking for "Solo/Partner/Friends/Family" was appreciated
- Email + City capture felt appropriate

## Recommended Changes for V2

### HIGH PRIORITY
1. **Clarify differentiation** - Add concrete examples of quests, show actual UI/screenshots if possible
2. **Reduce text** - Cut objection handling from 4 to 2, tighten How It Works section
3. **Fix social proof** - Remove "10,000+ explorers" until it's real, add actual beta user quotes with photos if available
4. **Strengthen headline** - Test more benefit-driven hooks

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
5. **Add pricing transparency** - Either mention it's free or set expectations
6. **More visuals** - Mockups, maps, example quests illustrated
7. **Sharpen testimonials** - Make them feel real with specific details

### LOW PRIORITY
8. **SEO considerations** - None mentioned, but could add location-based keywords
9. **Mobile optimization notes** - Ensure copy works on mobile (not tested here)

## Next Steps

Implement V2 based on high-priority changes and re-test with focus on:
- Clarity of value prop
- Reduced cognitive load
- Authenticity of social proof
