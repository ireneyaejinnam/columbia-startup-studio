## Problem / Solution

**Section Title:**
Tired of Doing the Same Things Every Weekend?

**The Problem:**
You want to spend more quality time outdoors together, but you've already been to all the "usual spots." Finding new places feels like too much work, so you end up staying in.

**The Solution:**
We turn your city into an interactive game board. Instead of scrolling through endless lists, you get personalized quests that guide you to amazing places you'd never find on your own.

## Objection Handling

**"I don't have time for this."**
Most quests take 1-2 hours—perfect for a Saturday morning or after-work adventure. You're already spending time outdoors; we just make it more fun.

**"I'm not a gamer."**
You don't need to be! If you've ever used a to-do list or fitness tracker, you'll love this. It's just structured exploration.

**"What if I've already been everywhere?"**
Our database includes 5,000+ spots per city, from famous landmarks to hyper-local secrets. We guarantee you'll find places you didn't know existed.

**"Is this just for couples?"**
Nope! Works great for solo explorers, friend groups, and families too. Couples mode is just one feature.
