## How It Works

**Section Title:**
3 Steps to More Adventures

**Step 1: Pick a Quest**
"Find 5 rooftop bars in Brooklyn" • "Hidden murals walking tour" • "Best tacos in a 2-mile radius"

**Step 2: Go Explore**
We guide you to each spot. Check in, snap a photo, complete the challenge. Play solo or with friends.

**Step 3: Level Up**
Earn badges, track your streak, unlock new quests. Compete on leaderboards and share your wins.

## The Problem (You Get It)

**"We've been everywhere already."**

Not true—your city has thousands of spots you've never tried. The problem? No structure. No motivation. No clear "next step."

That's where we come in.

## What Makes Us Different

**Not another list app.**

We don't just show you places. We create storylines.

**Example Quest: "Coffee Connoisseur"**
- Visit 5 indie coffee shops in your neighborhood
- Try a different brewing method at each
- Earn the "Barista's Best Friend" badge
- Unlock the "Roastery Tour" advanced quest

**The difference:** You're not scrolling reviews. You're on a mission. And missions are way more fun.

**Social features:** Invite friends to join quests, compete on city leaderboards, or share your achievements. Play your way.

## Two Quick Objections

**"I don't have time."**
Most quests = 1-2 hours. You're already going out for coffee or walks. We just make it count.

**"Will this work in my city?"**
Launching in **NYC & SF in March 2026**, with LA, Chicago, Austin, Portland, Seattle, and Denver following by **May 2026**.
