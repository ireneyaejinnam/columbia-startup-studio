## How It Works

### Section Title
3 Steps to More Adventures

### Step 1: Pick a Quest
"Find 5 rooftop bars in Brooklyn" • "Hidden murals walking tour" • "Best tacos in a 2-mile radius"

### Step 2: Go Explore
We guide you to each spot. Check in, snap a photo, complete the challenge. Play solo or with friends.

### Step 3: Level Up
Earn badges, track your streak, unlock new quests. Compete on leaderboards and share your wins.

## Problem Statement

### Section Title
The Problem (You Get It)

### Body Copy
**"We've been everywhere already."**

Not true—your city has thousands of spots you've never tried. The problem? No structure. No motivation. No clear "next step."

That's where we come in.

## Differentiation / Value Proposition

### Section Title
What Makes Us Different

### Intro
**Not another list app.**

We don't just show you places. We create storylines.

### Concrete Example
**Example Quest: "Coffee Connoisseur"**
- Visit 5 indie coffee shops in your neighborhood
- Try a different brewing method at each
- Earn the "Barista's Best Friend" badge
- Unlock the "Roastery Tour" advanced quest

**The difference:** You're not scrolling reviews. You're on a mission. And missions are way more fun.

### Social Features
**Social features:** Invite friends to join quests, compete on city leaderboards, or share your achievements. Play your way.

## Design Notes

- Warm, inviting tones (avoid cold corporate blues)
- Consider: Sunset oranges, forest greens, adventure yellows

### Typography

### Images/Visuals (if adding)
- Real photos of local spots (murals, rooftops, cafes)
- Happy couples/friends exploring
- App UI mockups (if available)
- Badge/achievement graphics

### Mobile Optimization
- Form should be easy to fill on mobile
- Steps should stack vertically
- CTAs should be thumb-friendly (large tap targets)

## A/B Test Ideas (Future)

Once you have traffic, test:
1. Headline variants (benefit-driven vs. game-driven)
2. CTA button text ("Get Early Access" vs. "Join Beta" vs. "Start Exploring")
3. Quest example (Coffee vs. Murals vs. Rooftop Bars)
4. Form length (just email vs. email + city + preference)
5. Pricing placement (before CTA vs. after CTA vs. omitted)

Start with V3 as written, then iterate based on real data.
