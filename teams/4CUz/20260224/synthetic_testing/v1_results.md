- 17x: Users expressed relief that it isn't another "app blocker," which many find frustrating and easy to bypass.
- 14x: Curiosity around the technical side—users want to know exactly what "subtle signals" look like before inviting friends.

## Strongest lines by frequency
- 26x: "You don’t need more willpower... You need awareness."
- 21x: "Awareness — not restriction — is the missing component."
- 18x: "Having friends quietly notice, rather than being monitored."

## Objections and dealbreakers

- 10x: "Subtle signals" is still a bit vague; I need to see a screenshot of the dashboard.
- 8x: Worried that "non-judgmental" signals might eventually just be ignored by my friends.
