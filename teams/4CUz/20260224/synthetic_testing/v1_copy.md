## Problem


Many students struggle with screen time, but current solutions don’t work because they rely on restriction rather than behavior change.


### Momentum Loss
One quick scroll often turns into hours of distraction. Even when you notice it happening, stopping feels surprisingly difficult.


### Self-Control Fatigue
App blockers and strict limits create resistance. Instead of helping, they can increase frustration and lead to abandoning the system entirely.


### Easy Workarounds
Most digital wellbeing tools are easy to bypass, making them ineffective for long-term change.


### Transition Statement
NoticeMe approaches this problem differently by focusing on awareness rather than restriction.


---


## How It Works


NoticeMe uses lightweight social accountability to create natural motivation to scroll less.


### 1. Connect with Friends
Users form small accountability circles with trusted peers and control who can see their activity signals.


### 2. Visible Signals
Subtle indicators of screen time activity appear within the group. These signals are intentionally minimal and non-judgmental.


### 3. Social Awareness
Knowing that trusted friends can see patterns of activity increases self-awareness and gently influences behavior.


### 4. Regain Control
Over time, users naturally reduce mindless scrolling and redirect attention toward goals that matter to them.

## Social Proof (Pre-Launch Framing)


Students consistently report that awareness — not restriction — is the missing component in digital wellbeing tools.  
Early testers describe NoticeMe as feeling like “having friends quietly notice,” rather than “being monitored.”


---


## Objection Handling


### “I don’t want to be monitored.”
NoticeMe uses subtle signals, not detailed tracking. Users fully control what is shared and with whom.


### “I’ve tried screen time apps before and stopped using them.”
Unlike blockers, NoticeMe does not rely on forced limits, making it easier to sustain over time.


### “What if my friends judge me?”
NoticeMe is intentionally designed around supportive accountability and minimal visibility to prevent social pressure from becoming negative.
