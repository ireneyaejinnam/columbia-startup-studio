## Top qualitative themes
- 26x: Specific examples like the "Focusing" status made the app feel "real" and easy to visualize.
- 21x: Users like the idea of a "Circle," suggesting a more private, curated experience than a general "friends list."
- 18x: The objection handling regarding "ignoring signals" provided a strong psychological reason why the app would work long-term.

## Strongest lines by frequency
- 31x: "You don’t need more willpower... You need awareness."
- 25x: "Subtle indicators... like a 'Focusing' status or a gentle 'Active for 30m' pulse."
- 22x: "Signals come from your actual friends, they carry more social weight."

## Objections and dealbreakers
- 10x: I want to know if I can "hide" my activity manually if I'm having a really bad day.
- 7x: Is there a limit to how many people can be in a "Circle"?
- 5x: Still a slight fear that I'll be the "worst" one in the group (social comparison).
