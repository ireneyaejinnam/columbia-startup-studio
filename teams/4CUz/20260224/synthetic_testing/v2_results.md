## Clarity accuracy breakdown
- wrong: 3
- partial: 15
- nailed_it: 42

## Top qualitative themes
- 24x: Strong preference for "Awareness" over "Restriction"; users feel less defensive about their habits with this framing.
- 19x: The "Waitlist" model makes the app feel like an exclusive community rather than just another utility.
- 15x: High interest in specific "Subtle Signals" (e.g., the "Focusing" status) as it provides a concrete mental image of the UI.

## Strongest lines by frequency
- 29x: “You don’t need more willpower to stop scrolling. You need awareness.”
- 22x: “Early testers describe NoticeMe as feeling like ‘having friends quietly notice,’ rather than ‘being monitored.’”
- 18x: “NoticeMe avoids punitive mechanisms.”

## Objections and dealbreakers
- 11x: Will the "signals" be too easy to ignore once the novelty wears off?
- 9x: Concern that "accountability circles" might be hard to maintain if friends have different study schedules.
- 6x: Potential for social anxiety if a user feels they are "scrolling too much" compared to the group.
- Dealbreaker count: 5 / 60

## Price perception
- too_expensive: 2
