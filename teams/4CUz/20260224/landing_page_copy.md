## Hero

### Headline (Pain + Reframe)
You don’t need more willpower to stop scrolling.  
You need awareness.

### Subheadline
NoticeMe helps you reduce mindless social media use through subtle social accountability — without blocking apps, setting punishments, or losing control.

## Problem

Many students struggle with screen time, but current solutions fail because they rely on restriction rather than behavior change.

### Momentum Loss
One quick scroll often turns into hours of distraction. Even when you notice it happening, stopping feels surprisingly difficult.

### Self-Control Fatigue
App blockers and strict limits create resistance. Instead of helping, they can increase frustration and lead to abandoning the system entirely.

### Easy Workarounds
Most digital wellbeing tools are easy to bypass, making them ineffective for long-term change.

## How It Works

NoticeMe uses lightweight social accountability to create natural motivation to scroll less.

### 1. Connect with Your Circle
Users form small accountability circles with trusted peers and control who can see their activity signals.

### 2. Live Subtle Signals
Subtle indicators of screen time activity — like a “Focusing” status or a gentle “Active for 30m” pulse — appear within your group. These signals are intentionally minimal and non-judgmental.

### 3. Mutual Awareness
Knowing that trusted friends can see patterns of activity increases self-awareness and gently influences behavior without the need for forced blocks.

### 4. Direct Your Attention
Over time, users naturally reduce mindless scrolling and redirect energy toward goals that matter to them.

## Why NoticeMe Works

NoticeMe is designed around behavioral science principles that prioritize autonomy, social influence, and intrinsic motivation.

### Social Accountability
Peer awareness creates meaningful behavioral feedback without external enforcement.

### No Blocking or Punishment
Users retain full control over their device usage while gaining supportive accountability.

### Privacy Control
Granular sharing settings allow users to choose what information is visible and to whom.

### Supportive Environment
The experience feels collaborative rather than restrictive, reducing “monitoring” anxiety.

## Social Proof

Students consistently report that awareness — not restriction — is the missing component in digital wellbeing tools.  
Early testers describe NoticeMe as feeling like “having friends quietly notice,” rather than “being monitored.”

---

## Objection Handling

### “I don’t want to be monitored.”
NoticeMe uses subtle signals, not detailed tracking. You control exactly what is shared and with whom.

### “What if my friends judge me?”
NoticeMe is designed for supportive accountability. Signals are minimal to prevent social pressure from becoming negative.

### “Will I just ignore the signals?”
Because the signals come from your actual friends, they carry more social weight than a standard automated app notification.
