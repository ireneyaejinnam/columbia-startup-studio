Problem: What's broken?
People collect tons of “things to do” (TikToks, IG saves, screenshots, notes), but those ideas don’t turn into real plans. Execution breaks because planning is fragmented and coordinating schedules with other people is annoying and time-consuming.
Context: Why does it matter now?
Young professionals are overloaded and digitally inspired all the time, but time is scarce. Most tools are either “content saving” (inspo) or “calendars” (obligations) and there’s no smooth bridge between the two, especially when friends are involved.
Idea: How might you solve it?
A lightweight way to turn saved inspiration into scheduled hangouts by centralizing “things I want to do,” making it easy to suggest/share with friends, and reducing scheduling friction through calendar-aware coordination (starting with Google Calendar).
THE 4 W'S
Who: Target customer?
Socially active, digitally native young professionals who use Google Calendar, save experience ideas online, and feel “busy” but want more meaningful time with friends.
What: What do they need?
A single place for “things I want to do” that isn’t another heavy productivity system
An easy way to revisit ideas at the right moment
A low-effort way to coordinate plans with friends (without endless back-and-forth)
Confidence that planning won’t feel like work or invade privacy
Where: Where does this happen?
On social media (TikTok/IG) when saving ideas
In group chats/texts when trying to plan
In Google Calendar when checking availability
In downtime moments (weekends, evenings, “what should we do?” situations)
Why: Why use your solution?
Because it reduces mental load and planning friction while helping people actually follow through on what excites them, leading to more intentional weeks and stronger friendships.

Saving posts/screenshots, daydreaming plans, texting “are you free?”, comparing schedules, trying to pick a time/place, giving up, defaulting to last-minute plans.

On-the-go scrolling, at home after work, commuting, weekend mornings, between meetings/classes, in social “planning” moments inside group chats.

Friends, partners, roommates, group chats, the “planner” friend, event hosts (sometimes).
