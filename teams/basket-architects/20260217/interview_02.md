# Interview 02 – Multi-Store Optimization Shopper

## Raw Notes
- Trigger: runs out of fresh vegetables → then grocery shopping
- Default stores: Trader Joe’s, local market, Amish market (close to home)
- Goes to Whole Foods/butcher for higher-quality meat
- Felt Eataly handmade pasta overpriced (taste not unique)
- Biggest friction: store distance
- Only checks prices for expensive/specialty items
- Sometimes visits 2 stores in one trip (e.g., Whole Foods for meat, local store for cheese)
- Wants smaller portion sizes for single-person household
