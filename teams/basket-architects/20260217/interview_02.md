# Interview 02 — Finding Places / Activities

**Interviewee:** College senior (CS) studying in the suburb  
**Context:** Choosing places to go (clubs, activities, outings)

---

## Discovery Process
Uses multiple platforms:
- Reddit (niche recommendations)
- Instagram (accounts and events)
- TikTok (ideas and trends)
- Google Maps (saving places)

> “Reddit has niche communities.”

---

## Planning Outings
Example: Halloween plans
- Didn’t want campus parties
- Wanted to go to the city 
- Searched Reddit + social media

---

## Saving System
Google Maps organization:
- Want to go
- Favorites
- Area folders (Union, school, etc.)
- Shares links with friends

---

## Pain Points
- Excessive scrolling
- Hard to evaluate quality
- Different tastes between people
- Bad experiences from recommendations

> “Went to a club Reddit recommended — it was cheap but terrible.”

---

## Trust Issues
Main challenge is not finding places — trusting them

> “Reddit doesn’t mean they have the same taste as me.”

---

## Desired Outcome
Wants recommendations filtered by similar preferences

> “A trusted taste source would help.”

---

## Takeaways
The core problem is matching recommendation taste rather than discovering new locations.
