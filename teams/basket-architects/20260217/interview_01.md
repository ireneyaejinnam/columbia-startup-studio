## Past Behavior (Home / Suburbs)
- Family shops across multiple stores:
    - Aldi → cheapest
    - Costco → bulk items
    - Target → membership savings
- Parent familiarity determines cheapest stores

> “My mom just knows where the cheapest things are.”

## Decision Factors

- Usually chooses one store per trip
- Might switch stores if total savings noticeable

> “If walking difference isn’t huge, sure.”

## Pain Points
