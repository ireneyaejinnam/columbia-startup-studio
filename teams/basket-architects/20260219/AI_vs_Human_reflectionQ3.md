# AI vs Human Reflection — Q3

## 3) Where to trust the AI’s read vs where not

### Trust more (AI is strong at)
- Extracting themes and structuring messy notes into clear patterns. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
- Translating insights into product constraints (auto-capture, social critical mass, trust guarantees). :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
- Turning weak signals into testable hypotheses and next experiments. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

### Trust less (treat as hypotheses / needs proof)
- Anything requiring exact quotes or facts unless explicitly pulled from the raw notes. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
- Strong segment conclusions from a small sample (5 people) — directionally useful, not definitive. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
- Over-weighting “fund allocation” as truth; it can be influenced by framing, novelty, and social desirability. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
