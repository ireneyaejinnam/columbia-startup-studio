# AI_Interview_Synthesis

**Based on:** 5 interviewees across 3 ideas (15 snapshots). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Key patterns across interviews
- Fragmentation is the universal pain: groceries fragment across stores; experiences fragment across apps/memory. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- People want less thinking: decision fatigue matters more than “features.” :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- Experience Ranker shows identity energy: rating language and strong preference signals. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- Silver Platter is niche: if it works, it is “verified quality + time saved,” not “luxury vibes.” :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
- Trust gates adoption: price accuracy, freshness, and quality consistency matter. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Top 5 diagnostic quotes
- “Not all stuff at one store.” :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
- “Everything in one place… especially online.” :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
- “One store doesn’t have everything.” :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
- “MoMA — mediocre 5/10 — crowd.” :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
- “Descriptions (are) not possible.” :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

## Contradictions and what they might mean
- HNI still checks prices → “price” often means “don’t waste money”; quality and label clarity still dominate. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
- People want an experience resume but won’t write → capture + summary must be automatic, not review-like. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
- Convenience vs quality → delivery wins only if perishables/freshness are consistently reliable. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

## Surprises
- Experience “rating language” already exists in the wild (5/10, mediocre). :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}
- Silver Platter interest, where present, is about verification not pampering. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
- Even higher-income users want clarity (labels, ingredients, trust signals). :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

## Overall read on the data
- Strongest direction right now: **Experience Ranker** (taste, ranking, network discovery). :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
- Second strongest: **RadiusCart** in price-sensitive segments (clear store-hopping pain). :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}
- Weakest for now: **Silver Platter**, unless repositioned as verified quality sourcing. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}

## Risk + winning path
- Key risk for Experience Ranker: manual logging friction. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}
- Winning path: auto-capture + one-tap rating + network layer. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}
