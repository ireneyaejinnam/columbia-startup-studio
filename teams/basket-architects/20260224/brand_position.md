## Canonical Language
- “Beli for experiences”
- “Your taste profile”

- “Less mediocre, more you”

- “Network-powered discovery” :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

## Language to Avoid
- Avoid: **social planning** — because it sounds like scheduling/logistics, not taste and ranking.
- Avoid: **event calendar** — because it implies generic listings, not personal meaning.
- Avoid: **reviews** — because users do not want to write essays (“descriptions not possible”).
- Avoid: **luxury / exclusive** — because the core is taste + signal, not status-for-status’s sake. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## Tone Guidelines
- Tasteful not hype — curator voice, not growth marketing.
- Specific not generic — concrete examples (5/10, mediocre), not buzzwords.
- Social not spammy — feels like sharing with friends.
- Effortless not demanding — the product does the work; the user taps once. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## Positioning Statement
For social, active people who rely on friends for what to do next, Experience Architects is the taste-based experience journal that helps you avoid mediocrity and recommend confidently because it captures real-life signals and ranks them into a personal profile. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## Brand Values
- Effortless capture over perfect detail — one tap beats long reviews.
- Taste over trends — personal signal beats generic “top 10” lists.
- Friends over algorithms — network trust first, ML second. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Objection Handling
| Objection | Your Response |
|---|---|
| I won’t write reviews. | You don’t have to: quick rating + optional tags; we auto-suggest from photos/location. |
| None of my friends will use it. | Useful solo (your ranked life). Social becomes a bonus layer when friends join. |
| Recommendations are generic everywhere. | Ours are tied to your taste + your network’s signal, not broad popularity. | :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

## Key Interview Language
- “MoMA — mediocre 5/10 — crowd.” — rating language already exists.
- “Descriptions (are) not possible.” — writing is a blocker; automation required.
- “network” — discovery and trust come from friends.
- “go all in for the third idea” — strongest preference signal. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
