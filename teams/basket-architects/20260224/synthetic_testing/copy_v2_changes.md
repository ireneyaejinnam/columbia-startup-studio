# Copy V2 Changes — Decision Log

**Version:** V2 (from V1)
**Date:** February 23, 2026

## Changes from V1

- **Section:** Hero subhead
  **Change:** Added forward-looking language. Was: "...so you stop forgetting the great ones, stop repeating the mediocre ones, and start recommending like you mean it." Now adds: "...and discover what's next through the people you trust."
  **Why:** fomo_scroller resonance-conversion gap (75% → 17%). The hero set a backward-looking frame ("remember, rank") that persisted through the whole page. Adding discovery to the hero reframes the entire read. (Framing change = highest leverage per best practices.)

- **Section:** Problem
  **Change:** Added a closing paragraph that pivots from "you forget what you did" to "you don't know what to do next." New lines address the fomo_scroller pain point: defaulting to the same places, scrolling for inspiration and never acting.
  **Why:** 5 of 12 fomo_scroller personas said the copy addresses their past but not their future. "I need help deciding what to do, not recording what I've done." The problem section now names both pains.

- **Section:** Network Discovery
  **Change:** Added a "before your friends join" paragraph addressing cold start. Explains solo value (your personal taste map is useful alone) and hints at community discovery (local signal, not just friend signal). Also added one line clarifying Beli reference: "Think Beli — the restaurant ranking app — but for everything."
  **Why:** Cold-start was the #1 objection for city_explorer (12/12 mentioned it) and a top-3 for social_connector. Also, 2 fomo_scroller personas didn't know what Beli was and found the reference confusing.

- **Section:** NEW — "What keeps you coming back" (inserted between How It Works and Social Proof)
  **Change:** New 4-line section addressing retention. Mentions: weekly taste recaps, friend activity nudges, and the compound effect of a growing profile ("the more you rate, the sharper your recommendations get").
  **Why:** journal_graveyard's #1 objection (8/12 personas). "The copy sells the first day but not the thirtieth day." This bucket's dealbreakers are structural (behavior change), not copy quality. Even 3-4 lines of retention messaging could shift their calculus.

- **Section:** Solution
  **Change:** Added one line: "Rate it now, or add it later — last week's dinner, last month's trip. Your profile doesn't care about timestamps." 
  **Why:** 3 journal_graveyard personas asked about retroactive entries. Removing the real-time pressure lowers the perceived effort bar.

- **Section:** Pricing
  **Change:** Added "Invite 3 friends and get a free month of Pro" referral incentive. Also clarified that free includes "basic friend activity" (seeing friends' ratings, not full discovery).
  **Why:** Social features paywall was objected to in 4/5 buckets. Rather than removing the paywall entirely, this: (a) gives social_connectors an onramp that aligns with their natural behavior (inviting friends), and (b) clarifies that free isn't completely solo.

- **Section:** Social Proof
  **Change:** Replaced "Early tester, Brooklyn" attribution with slightly more specific attributions that feel less manufactured. Added a fifth testimonial specifically about retention: "Three months in and I still rate everything. It takes literally two seconds."
  **Why:** V1 testimonials were flagged as "slightly manufactured" by taste_curator. The retention testimonial directly addresses journal_graveyard's concern.

## What I'm Watching For in V2

- **fomo_scroller conversion** — Does the forward-looking reframe close the 58pp resonance-conversion gap? Target: >30% conversion (up from 17%).
- **city_explorer cold-start objection** — Does the "before your friends join" paragraph reduce cold-start mentions? Their conversion is already 75%, so we're protecting it while removing the main remaining concern.
- **journal_graveyard retention signal** — Does the "what keeps you coming back" section reduce dealbreakers from 25%? Target: <20%.
- **social_connector paywall objection** — Does the referral incentive + free basic friend activity reduce "friends won't pay" concerns?
- **Overall conversion** — Target: >50% agree+ (stopping criterion).
