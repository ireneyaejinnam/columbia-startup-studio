# Copy V5 Changes — Decision Log

**Version:** V5 (from V4)
**Date:** February 23, 2026

---

## Strategic Direction

V5 is a **convergence test**. V4 hit 77% conversion with all qualitative feedback pointing to the copy ceiling ("my objections are product-level, not copy-level"). The purpose of V5 is to verify that V4's results are stable, not a lucky roll.

Changes are intentionally minimal — small polish only. If V5 metrics are within 3pp of V4, we declare convergence and move to the final report.

## Changes from V4

- **Section:** Hero subhead
  **Change:** Minor word tightening. Removed "random Tuesday night plans" (flagged twice across rounds as slightly forced). Replaced with "the things you actually do" — more natural, less performed.
  **Why:** Multiple personas flagged this phrase as the one slightly try-hard moment in otherwise confident copy. Micro-polish, not a strategic change.

- **Section:** Pricing — Free tier
  **Change:** Added one clause: "basic friend activity — see what friends rate nearby." Clarifies what "basic friend activity" means in the free tier.
  **Why:** "What does basic friend activity include?" was asked by social_connector and fomo_scroller across V2-V4. One clause resolves an FAQ without adding length.

- **Section:** Pricing — Pro tier
  **Change:** Replaced vague "priority in local discovery" (flagged as undefined across 3 rounds) with "local trending — see what's popular in your area beyond your friend group."
  **Why:** "Priority in local discovery" was flagged by taste_curator, city_explorer, and social_connector as meaningless. "Local trending" is specific and directly addresses city_explorer's #1 product request (community discovery beyond friends). This is a minor copy change that signals a product capability.

- **Section:** Everything else
  **Change:** No changes. Hero headline, problem, solution, network discovery, how it works, retention, social proof, final CTA all remain at V4.
  **Why:** V4 is performing at or near ceiling in every section. Changing anything load-bearing risks regression (V3's lesson). Polish only.

## What I'm Watching For in V5

- **Convergence**: All core metrics within ±3pp of V4
- **city_explorer dealbreakers**: Does "local trending" address the community discovery concern? (25% → target <17%)
- **Price perception stability**: V4 had a "too_expensive" uptick. Does V5 stabilize?
- **Qualitative convergence**: Do personas continue saying "the copy is done"?
