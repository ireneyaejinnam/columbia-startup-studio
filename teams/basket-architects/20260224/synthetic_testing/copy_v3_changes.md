# Copy V3 Changes — Decision Log

**Version:** V3 (from V2)
**Date:** February 23, 2026

---

## Strategic Direction

V2 hit 67% conversion but qualitative feedback surfaced two themes:
1. **The page is getting long** — mentioned across buckets, especially problematic for Instagram/TikTok ad traffic (short attention spans, mobile screens).
2. **Remaining objections are product-level, not copy-level** — personas want to see the interface, try features, verify retention. Copy can't solve this, but it CAN reduce friction by being tighter and more confident.

V3 strategy: **Tighten, don't add.** Trim ~20% of copy length. Make every section earn its space. This is a structural change (per best practices: structural changes = 3-8pp shifts) but the goal is protecting conversion while improving the mobile experience.

## Changes from V2

- **Section:** Problem
  **Change:** Trimmed from 4 paragraphs to 3. Merged the "same three places" paragraph and the "scrolling best-of lists" paragraph into one tighter paragraph that hits both pains.
  **Why:** The problem section grew in V2 to address fomo_scroller. It worked — but at the cost of length. The two pains (forgetting good places + not discovering new ones) can be in one paragraph.

- **Section:** Solution
  **Change:** Tightened. Removed the "Your 8/10 Thai place / 4/10 tourist trap / 10/10 speakeasy" examples paragraph. Kept the first example inline. Moved "Rate it now or add it later" up to directly follow "One tap."
  **Why:** The examples were highly cited in V1 but by V2 only one persona mentioned them as strongest line. They've served their purpose establishing the mental model. Cutting saves 3 lines without losing the core message. The retroactive rating line is more important and gets elevated.

- **Section:** Network Discovery
  **Change:** Tightened the "before your friends join" paragraph to 2 sentences (was 4). Kept the key line: "First it's your map. Then it's your map plus everyone you trust." Removed the explanatory sentences around it.
  **Why:** "First it's your map" is the #2 most-cited line in V2. The surrounding explanation dilutes its impact. The line is strong enough to stand with minimal setup.

- **Section:** How It Works
  **Change:** No change. Already tight.
  **Why:** Three steps, three lines. No fat.

- **Section:** What Keeps You Coming Back
  **Change:** Tightened from 2 paragraphs to 1. Cut "Most apps like this die after a week. We know that." opening — it's strong but risky (V2 feedback: "acknowledging weakness mid-pitch is risky"). Kept the mechanics: weekly recaps, friend nudges, compounding profile.
  **Why:** Split decision. The honesty line was cited by journal_graveyard as strongest. But taste_curator and social_connector flagged it as signaling insecurity. For a tighter page, leading with the mechanics is more efficient. The three-month testimonial in social proof carries the retention proof instead.

- **Section:** Social Proof
  **Change:** No content change. Testimonials are working.
  **Why:** All five testimonials earned citations. No reason to change.

- **Section:** Pricing
  **Change:** Added "or $99/year" annual option alongside $12/month. Multiple personas across buckets requested annual pricing.
  **Why:** 4+ personas said they'd commit faster with an annual discount. $99/year ($8.25/mo effective) is a common SaaS anchor that makes monthly feel like the "premium" option while annual feels like the "smart" choice.

- **Section:** Pro features
  **Change:** Replaced vague "taste analytics that show you patterns" with "taste analytics — see which neighborhoods you rate highest, how your taste compares to friends, and which categories you're pickiest about."
  **Why:** taste_curator flagged "taste analytics" as undefined in V2. Specificity converts — this was the lesson of V1.

## What I'm Watching For in V3

- **Does trimming hurt conversion?** If conversion drops >5pp, the cut content was load-bearing. If it holds or improves, the page was too long.
- **fomo_scroller** — Can we push from 50% toward 60%? The forward-looking frame is landing; tighter delivery might help mobile scrollers.
- **journal_graveyard** — Does removing the "most apps die" honesty line hurt or help? Watch their resonance and dealbreaker rate.
- **Price perception** — Does the annual option shift "too expensive" further down?
- **Network believability** — Dipped 7pp in V2. Is this noise or a real signal? Tighter network section might help or hurt.
