## Problem

You've been to hundreds of places. You remember maybe twenty.

Someone texts you "where should we eat tonight?" and your mind goes blank — even though last month you had the best meal of the year somewhere and now you can't remember the name. Your Notes app has a graveyard of half-typed restaurant names. Your Google Maps saves are a wall of pins with no context. Your Instagram saves? You'll never scroll back through those.

Meanwhile, you keep ending up at the same three places. Or worse — you try somewhere new based on a Yelp rating from a stranger and it's painfully average.

Your taste deserves better than this.

## Solution

One tap. That's it.

After any experience — dinner, a hike, a comedy show, a bar you stumbled into at midnight — rate it. One tap, one number. No review. No paragraph. No photo required.

Experience Architects takes that single signal and builds your taste profile over time. Not a list. Not a journal. A living, ranked record of what you've done and what you actually thought of it.

Your 8/10 Thai place in the East Village. Your 4/10 tourist trap in Miami. The 10/10 speakeasy your friend dragged you to that you'd never have found alone.

It's all there. Searchable. Sortable. Yours.

## Network Discovery

Here's where it gets interesting.

Your friends are rating too. And their taste profiles feed yours — not through some algorithm guessing what you might like based on 50 million strangers, but through the actual people you trust.

Your friend who always finds the best dive bars? You'll see their top-rated spots in your neighborhood. The one with perfect restaurant taste? Their 9s and 10s surface when you're looking for somewhere new.

Think Beli, but for everything — not just restaurants. Bars, hikes, day trips, shows, classes, pop-ups. If you did it and it's worth ranking, it belongs here.

Network-powered discovery that actually feels like getting a rec from a friend. Because it is one.

## How It Works

**Rate** — Tap to rate any experience. One number. Two seconds. Done.

**Build** — Your taste profile grows with every rating. It learns what you love, what you skip, and what you'd recommend without hesitation.

**Discover** — See what's highly rated by the people you actually trust. No strangers. No sponsored posts. Just your network's real signal.
