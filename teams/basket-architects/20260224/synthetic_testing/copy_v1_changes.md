# Copy V1 Changes — Decision Log

**Version:** V1 (first draft — decisions vs. baseline)
**Date:** February 23, 2026

## Framing Decisions

**Hero: "Your social life, ranked."**
- Chose the canonical brand language directly. Short, punchy, identity-driven.
- Subhead expands into the three jobs: remember, avoid mediocre, recommend. Hits all three in one sentence.
- Avoided "track your experiences" (baseline language) — too functional, no identity.

**Problem section: Memory-based framing**
- Led with the emotional pain of forgetting, not the functional problem of not having an app.
- "You've been to hundreds of places. You remember maybe twenty." — specific, concrete, immediately relatable.
- Named the failed alternatives (Notes app, Google Maps saves, Instagram saves, Yelp ratings from strangers) because every bucket has tried at least one.
- Closed with "Your taste deserves better than this" — positions the user as someone with taste, not someone with a problem. Aspirational, not desperate.

**Solution section: "One tap. That's it."**
- Addressed the #1 objection from brand doc: "I won't write reviews" / "Descriptions not possible."
- Made effortlessness the headline of the solution, not a feature bullet.
- "Not a list. Not a journal. A living, ranked record." — explicitly distances from failed categories (journal_graveyard bucket in particular).
- Used specific examples (8/10 Thai place, 4/10 tourist trap, 10/10 speakeasy) to make the rating system tangible. Borrowed the "MoMA — mediocre 5/10" interview language pattern.

**Network section: Friends > algorithms**
- Positioned network discovery as the differentiator, not an add-on.
- "Not through some algorithm guessing... but through the actual people you trust" — directly attacks Yelp/Google model.
- "Think Beli, but for everything" — canonical language, instant positioning for people who know Beli.
- Closed with "Because it is one" (a rec from a friend) — emotional landing, trust-building.

## Structural Decisions

- **Problem before solution.** Classic problem-agitate-solve. The baseline jumped straight to features.
- **Network discovery gets its own section** rather than being buried in features. It's the biggest differentiator and the hardest to believe — needs space.
- **Social proof uses specific cities and specific use cases.** Baseline used generic "I like this app" quotes. V1 ties each quote to a bucket-relevant scenario.
- **Pricing: Free tier is generous and explicitly stated.** "This isn't a trial. It's the real product." Counters the skepticism that free = crippled.
- **Pro at $12/month** — midpoint of the $7-18 range. Testing perception before committing to either end.
- **Final CTA uses "Less mediocre. More you."** — canonical brand language, identity-driven close.

## Tone Decisions

- Conversational, second-person throughout. "You" in every section.
- Specific over generic (brand guideline). Numbers, place names, scenarios.
- No exclamation points. No hype words. Curator voice per brand doc.
- Allowed humor in small doses ("a bar you stumbled into at midnight") without being try-hard.

## What I'm Watching For

- **Resonance on the problem section** — does "you've been to hundreds of places, you remember maybe twenty" land across all buckets?
- **Network believability** — does the friends-based discovery promise feel real or like marketing?
- **Journal graveyard skepticism** — does "one tap, that's it" overcome their burned-before resistance?
- **Price reaction at $12/mo** — is Pro perceived as fair when Free is this generous?
- **Clarity** — do people understand this is a taste profile + network discovery, or do they think it's just another tracking app?
