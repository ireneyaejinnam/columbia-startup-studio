# Copy V4 Changes — Decision Log

**Version:** V4 (from V3)
**Date:** February 23, 2026

---

## Strategic Direction

V4 is a hybrid: V3's tighter structure + surgical restoration of three specific elements the data proved were load-bearing. Net length: ~5% longer than V3, still ~15% shorter than V2.

## Changes from V3

- **Section:** Solution
  **Change:** Restored the specific rating examples as a single compact line: "Your 8/10 Thai place. Your 4/10 tourist trap. The 10/10 speakeasy you'd never have found alone."
  **Why:** taste_curator conversion dropped 8pp when these were removed in V3. These examples prove the team understands how the audience thinks about experiences (in specific numbers, not abstract concepts). V1 data showed these were the 3rd most-cited strongest line for taste_curator. Restored as one line instead of a full paragraph to maintain V3's pace.

- **Section:** What Keeps You Coming Back
  **Change:** Restored the honesty opening: "Most apps like this die after a week. We know that." followed directly by the retention mechanics.
  **Why:** journal_graveyard resonance crashed 25pp (50% → 25%) when this was removed in V3. Multiple personas explicitly noted its absence. The line earned trust by naming the exact pattern they live with. Restoring it adds ~15 words — minimal length impact, maximum trust impact. The three-month testimonial is proof; this line is permission to believe.

- **Section:** Network Discovery
  **Change:** Expanded cold-start paragraph from 1 sentence to 2. Was: "First it's your map. Then it's your map plus everyone you trust." Now: "And before your friends join? Your personal taste profile works from day one — a searchable, ranked map of everything you've experienced. First it's your map. Then it's your map plus everyone you trust."
  **Why:** city_explorer conversion dropped 34pp (92% → 58%) when the cold-start explanation was trimmed to one line. The standalone punchline is powerful but doesn't fully address their concern ("what's the day-one experience?"). Two sentences of context restore the reassurance without returning to V2's 4-sentence version.

- **Section:** Everything else
  **Change:** No changes. Problem section, hero, pricing, social proof, How It Works, final CTA all remain at V3 versions.
  **Why:** V3 improvements in these sections were universally positive: tighter problem section drove fomo_scroller to 75% conversion, annual pricing drove price perception to best-ever, taste analytics specificity drove taste_curator resonance to 92%. Protect what's working.

## What I'm Watching For in V4

- **Overall conversion** — Target: recover to >65%, ideally combine V2's 67% with V3's other gains.
- **journal_graveyard resonance** — Should recover from 25% toward V2's 50%. The honesty line is the mechanism.
- **city_explorer conversion** — Should recover from 58% toward V2's 92%. The cold-start context is the mechanism.
- **taste_curator conversion** — Should recover from 67% toward V2's 75%. The examples are the mechanism.
- **fomo_scroller** — Protect the 75% conversion. Nothing that helped them was touched.
- **Price perception** — Should maintain V3's best-ever numbers. No pricing changes.
- **Convergence check** — If V4 metrics are within 3pp of V2's best numbers, we may be approaching the copy ceiling.
