## Per-Bucket Breakdown

### taste_curator (12 personas)

| Metric | V1 | BL | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resonance agree+ | 50% | 10% | +40pp |
| Conversion agree+ | **58%** | 0% | +58pp |
| Network agree+ | 50% | 10% | +40pp |
| Dealbreakers | 17% | 42% | -25pp |
| Clarity nailed_it | 92% | 0% | +92pp |

**Key findings:** The framing shift from "track experiences" to "your taste deserves a system" transformed this bucket. The specific examples (8/10 Thai place, 4/10 tourist trap) validated the product understands how they think. Remaining objections center on needing to see the actual interface and concerns about category handling.

**Risk:** Two dealbreakers remain, both about paywalled network features preventing evaluation.

### social_connector (12 personas)

| Metric | V1 | BL | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resonance agree+ | **75%** | 15% | +60pp |
| Conversion agree+ | **50%** | 0% | +50pp |
| Network agree+ | **83%** | 15% | +68pp |
| Dealbreakers | 8% | 8% | 0pp |
| Clarity nailed_it | 83% | 0% | +83pp |

**Key findings:** Highest resonance and network believability across all buckets. The "your friend who always finds the best dive bars" line was the most cited strongest line. The network discovery section landed perfectly with this audience. The "send them my profile" testimonial hit their exact use case.

**Risk:** Conversion (50%) lags resonance (75%) — classic resonance-conversion gap. They love the concept but hesitate because they can't control whether friends will join. The paywalled social features are the primary blocker.

### journal_graveyard (12 personas)

| Metric | V1 | BL | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resonance agree+ | 25% | 5% | +20pp |
| Conversion agree+ | **17%** | 0% | +17pp |
| Network agree+ | 33% | 5% | +28pp |
| Dealbreakers | 25% | 58% | -33pp |
| Clarity nailed_it | 83% | 0% | +83pp |

**Key findings:** Toughest bucket but still improved. The "one tap, that's it" promise is the single line keeping them engaged — mentioned by 8 of 12 as strongest line. Dealbreakers dropped from 58% to 25%, which is significant. Remaining dealbreakers are about retention and automation — they need proof the app solves the abandonment pattern, not just the logging interface.

**Key insight:** "The copy never addresses retention. It sells the first day but not the thirtieth day." This is the clearest V2 opportunity for this bucket.

**Risk:** 25% dealbreaker rate is still the highest. These are structural dealbreakers (behavior change, not copy quality). May need a retention-focused section.

### fomo_scroller (12 personas)

| Metric | V1 | BL | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resonance agree+ | **75%** | 15% | +60pp |
| Conversion agree+ | **17%** | 8% | +9pp |
| Network agree+ | **75%** | 10% | +65pp |
| Dealbreakers | 17% | 17% | 0pp |
| Clarity nailed_it | 83% | 0% | +83pp |

**Key findings:** Second-biggest resonance-conversion gap (75% vs 17%). This bucket LOVES the framing — "you keep ending up at the same three places" is their most cited line. They believe the network concept. But conversion is stuck because the copy is about building a record of what you've done, while they need help doing MORE things.

**Key insight:** "The page is about building a record of what you've done. I need help deciding what to do." Multiple personas said the discovery features are their hook but they're paywalled and the free version only offers tracking.

**Risk:** This is the clearest framing opportunity for V2. The resonance-conversion gap suggests the product COULD serve them — the copy just emphasizes the wrong half.

### city_explorer (12 personas)

| Metric | V1 | BL | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resonance agree+ | **67%** | 20% | +47pp |
| Conversion agree+ | **75%** | 25% | +50pp |
| Network agree+ | **67%** | 15% | +52pp |
| Dealbreakers | 8% | 8% | 0pp |
| Clarity nailed_it | **100%** | 0% | +100pp |

**Key findings:** Highest conversion bucket by far. This audience has the strongest unmet need and the V1 copy's network discovery promise maps directly to their situation. 100% clarity — every persona understood exactly what the product does. The Chicago testimonial ("friends' ratings better than any 'best of' list") was cited repeatedly.

**Risk:** The cold-start problem is the #1 objection. "What if I don't have local friends on the app?" This needs explicit addressing — community discovery, local tastemakers, or a clear solo value proposition.

## Strongest Lines (by frequency across all buckets)

| Line | Mentions | Primary Buckets |
|---|---|---|
| "One tap. That's it." / "One tap, one number. No review." | 11 | journal_graveyard, taste_curator |
| "Network-powered discovery that actually feels like getting a rec from a friend. Because it is one." | 8 | city_explorer, social_connector |
| "Your friend who always finds the best dive bars? You'll see their top-rated spots." | 7 | social_connector, city_explorer |
| "You've been to hundreds of places. You remember maybe twenty." | 5 | taste_curator, fomo_scroller |
| "Less mediocre. More you." | 5 | fomo_scroller, city_explorer |
| "Your taste deserves better than this." | 4 | taste_curator, fomo_scroller |
| "Think Beli, but for everything." | 4 | social_connector, city_explorer |
| "Not a list. Not a journal. A living, ranked record." | 3 | taste_curator, journal_graveyard |

## Top Qualitative Themes

### What's Working
1. **Emotional framing of the problem** — "you've been to hundreds of places, you remember maybe twenty" lands universally. Specific > generic.
2. **One-tap effortlessness** — the single most important line for journal_graveyard and a strong signal across all buckets.
3. **Network discovery positioning** — "because it IS a rec from a friend" is the highest-resonance concept. 62% network believability is the breakout metric.
4. **Specific examples** (8/10 Thai place, 4/10 tourist trap) — validate that the team understands the user's mental model.
5. **"Beli for everything"** — instant positioning for people who know Beli. Slight risk for those who don't.

### What Needs Work
1. **Resonance-conversion gap in fomo_scroller** (75% → 17%) — copy speaks to them emotionally but solution is positioned as backward-looking (record what you did) vs. forward-looking (discover what to do). **Highest-leverage V2 fix.**
2. **Cold-start problem unaddressed** — city_explorer and social_connector both ask "what if I'm the first one?" No answer on the page.
3. **Retention not addressed** — journal_graveyard specifically asks "what keeps me coming back after week one?" The copy sells the first open, not the thirtieth.
4. **Social features paywalled** — mentioned as an objection in 4 of 5 buckets. The network IS the product for social_connector and city_explorer, but it's behind $12/mo.
5. **"Beli" reference unclear to some** — fomo_scroller personas who don't know Beli found it confusing rather than clarifying.

### Dealbreaker Themes (9 total)

| Theme | Count | Buckets |
|---|---|---|
| No retention mechanism / will abandon | 3 | journal_graveyard |
| Network features paywalled | 2 | social_connector, taste_curator |
| Still requires manual input | 2 | journal_graveyard |
| Discovery paywalled / free version insufficient | 1 | fomo_scroller |
| No community discovery for newcomers | 1 | city_explorer |

## Price Perception Shift

Price perception improved dramatically:

| | V1 | Baseline |
|---|---|---|
| Too Expensive | 23% | 50% |
| Fair | 60% | 40% |
| Good Deal | 17% | 10% |

The V1 copy's generous free tier framing ("This isn't a trial. It's the real product.") and the explicit value proposition for Pro shifted perception significantly. However, the paywall on social features is generating friction — multiple personas suggest social basics should be free to drive adoption.

## Recommendations for V2

Ranked by expected impact:

1. **Add a forward-looking discovery frame for fomo_scroller** — The copy currently says "here's what you did." Add messaging about "here's what to do next." This is a framing change (highest-leverage variable per best practices) that could close the 58pp resonance-conversion gap.

2. **Address cold-start explicitly** — Add 1-2 sentences about what the experience is like before friends join. Solo value (your personal taste map) + community discovery layer (local trending, power users) would neutralize the #1 city_explorer objection.

3. **Add a retention-focused section for journal_graveyard** — Even 2-3 lines about "the app that brings you back" — push notifications, weekly taste recaps, friend activity nudges. Address "what happens on day 30."

4. **Reconsider social feature paywall language** — Don't necessarily change pricing, but the copy could better explain what free social features exist (if any) or introduce a trial/referral path for Pro.

5. **Add "Beli" context for non-Beli users** — "Think Beli — the restaurant ranking app — but for everything" adds one clause and removes the confusion.

## V1 → V2 Priority

The fomo_scroller resonance-conversion gap is the single highest-leverage opportunity. A framing change to make the discovery angle more forward-looking could produce a 20-30pp conversion swing in that bucket without touching anything that's working.
