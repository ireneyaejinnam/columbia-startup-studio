## Per-Bucket Breakdown (Cross-Version)

### taste_curator

| Metric | BL | V1 | V2 | V1→V2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Resonance agree+ | 10% | 50% | **83%** | +33pp 🟢 |
| Conversion agree+ | 0% | 58% | **75%** | +17pp 🟢 |
| Dealbreakers | 42% | 17% | **17%** | 0pp |

**Story:** Now the second-strongest bucket. The retroactive rating line and refined pricing landed well. Remaining objections are product-level (need to see UX, want data portability) — not copy-level. This bucket is maxed on what copy can do.

### social_connector

| Metric | BL | V1 | V2 | V1→V2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Resonance agree+ | 15% | 75% | **75%** | 0pp |
| Conversion agree+ | 0% | 50% | **75%** | +25pp 🟢 |
| Dealbreakers | 8% | 8% | **0%** | -8pp 🟢 |

**Story:** The resonance-conversion gap from V1 (75% → 50%) is now closed (75% → 75%). The referral incentive + free basic friend activity directly addressed their concern. Zero dealbreakers. The invite flow is their remaining question — product-level, not copy-level.

### journal_graveyard

| Metric | BL | V1 | V2 | V1→V2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Resonance agree+ | 5% | 25% | **50%** | +25pp 🟢 |
| Conversion agree+ | 0% | 17% | **42%** | +25pp 🟢 |
| Dealbreakers | 58% | 25% | **25%** | 0pp |

**Story:** The retention section produced the intended lift. "Most apps like this die after a week. We know that." was cited as strongest line by 2 personas — the honesty lands. Retroactive entries and compound value argument moved the needle. However, 25% dealbreakers persist — these are structural (behavioral change required) and unlikely to be solved by copy alone. Their remaining objections are about passive tracking and proof of retention, which require product evidence.

**Key quote:** "My objection isn't the copy anymore — it's my own behavior. That's progress."

### fomo_scroller

| Metric | BL | V1 | V2 | V1→V2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Resonance agree+ | 15% | 75% | **42%** | -33pp 🔴 |
| Conversion agree+ | 8% | 17% | **50%** | +33pp 🟢 |
| Dealbreakers | 17% | 17% | **17%** | 0pp |

**Story:** The forward-looking reframe worked exactly as predicted — conversion tripled from 17% to 50%. "Choosing feels like work when you don't have a system" became the most-cited line for this bucket. The resonance-conversion gap from V1 is now inverted in an interesting way: resonance dropped while conversion jumped. This likely means the V2 copy is less emotionally flattering but more action-driving. The V1 copy made them feel seen; V2 makes them feel like acting. That's the right trade.

**Key insight:** "V1 told me to record my life. V2 tells me to upgrade it. Big difference."

### city_explorer

| Metric | BL | V1 | V2 | V1→V2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Resonance agree+ | 20% | 67% | **50%** | -17pp |
| Conversion agree+ | 25% | 75% | **92%** | +17pp 🟢 |
| Dealbreakers | 8% | 8% | **17%** | +9pp |

**Story:** Highest conversion at 92%. The cold-start paragraph ("First it's your map. Then it's your map plus everyone you trust.") was the most-cited new line. 11 of 12 would consider signing up. Resonance dipped slightly — possibly because the page is longer and this bucket is action-oriented (they want to try, not read). The one remaining dealbreaker wants community discovery beyond friends. Dealbreaker uptick to 17% is small-sample noise (1 additional persona).

**Key line:** "First it's your map. Then it's your map plus everyone you trust."

## Strongest Lines by Frequency (V2)

| Line | Mentions | Change from V1 |
|---|---|---|
| "One tap. That's it." | 8 | Maintained |
| "First it's your map. Then it's your map plus everyone you trust." | 7 | **NEW** ⭐ |
| "Choosing feels like work when you don't have a system." | 5 | **NEW** ⭐ |
| "Invite 3 friends → get your first month of Pro free." | 5 | **NEW** ⭐ |
| "Most apps like this die after a week. We know that." | 4 | **NEW** ⭐ |
| "Network-powered discovery... Because it is one." | 4 | Maintained |
| "Less mediocre. More you." | 4 | Maintained |
| "This isn't an app you have to remember to open. It's one that gives you reasons to." | 3 | **NEW** ⭐ |

Four of the top 8 strongest lines are new to V2. All four target the specific bucket concerns identified in V1.

## Qualitative Theme Shifts (V1 → V2)

### Resolved or Reduced
- ✅ **"Copy is backward-looking"** — fomo_scroller no longer raises this. Discovery reframe worked.
- ✅ **"What about cold start?"** — city_explorer acknowledged the paragraph addresses this. Still want community features but not a blocker.
- ✅ **"Social features paywalled"** — reduced across all buckets. Free basic friend activity + referral incentive addressed the core concern.
- ✅ **"What is Beli?"** — clarification eliminated confusion.

### Persisting
- ⚠️ **"Need to see the actual product"** — 3+ buckets. This is healthy — it means the copy has done its job and they're ready for the next step (app experience).
- ⚠️ **"No passive tracking"** — journal_graveyard. Structural product limitation, not solvable by copy.
- ⚠️ **"Community discovery beyond friends"** — city_explorer. Would require product feature, not copy change.
- ⚠️ **"Page is getting long"** — mentioned across buckets. Consider trimming for mobile.

### New Concerns
- 🆕 **"Taste analytics undefined"** — taste_curator wants specificity on what Pro analytics show. Low priority but easy win.
- 🆕 **"Retention section promises vs. proof"** — journal_graveyard trusts the honesty but wants data. Not solvable until real retention data exists.

## Dealbreaker Analysis (V2: 9 total, 15%)

| Bucket | Count | Themes |
|---|---|---|
| journal_graveyard | 3 | No passive tracking; retention is promises not proof |
| taste_curator | 2 | Need to see UX before committing |
| fomo_scroller | 2 | Full discovery still paywalled in free |
| city_explorer | 2 | Need community discovery beyond friends |
| social_connector | 0 | — |

The dealbreakers are now almost entirely product-level concerns, not copy-level. This is the signal that the copy has reached diminishing returns.

## Assessment

**We're at V2 with 67% conversion, crossing the >50% stopping criterion after minimum rounds not yet met (need 5).**

The qualitative feedback has shifted from copy concerns to product concerns — personas want to see the interface, try the features, and verify the retention mechanics. This is the natural ceiling of what landing page copy can achieve.

### Options

1. **Continue iterating (V3-V5)** — Still below the 5-round minimum. Could target: page length trimming for mobile, taste analytics specificity, and squeeze more from fomo_scroller (50% → higher). Diminishing returns are likely but the minimum round requirement exists for a reason — a lucky V2 needs validation.

2. **Stop here** — 67% conversion, 100% clarity, 15% dealbreakers (mostly structural). The copy is doing its job. Remaining objections are product-level. Could move to real user testing.

3. **A/B test** — Run two V3 variants: one trimmed for mobile (shorter) vs. current length. Test whether length is hurting mobile conversion.
