## Top-Line Metrics (Cross-Version)

| Dimension | BL | V1 | V2 | V3 | V2→V3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Resonance agree+** | 17% | 58% | 60% | **68%** | +8pp 🟢 |
| **Intent agree+** | 12% | 37% | 63% | **57%** | -6pp 🔴 |
| **Conversion agree+** | 7% | 43% | 67% | **60%** | -7pp 🔴 |
| **Network agree+** | 7% | 62% | 55% | **62%** | +7pp 🟢 |
| **Clarity nailed_it** | 0% | 88% | 100% | **100%** | 0pp |
| **Dealbreakers** | 27% | 15% | 15% | **10%** | -5pp 🟢 |
| **Price: too_expensive** | 50% | 23% | 27% | **17%** | -10pp 🟢 |
| **Price: fair** | 40% | 60% | 45% | **50%** | +5pp 🟢 |
| **Price: good_deal** | 10% | 17% | 28% | **33%** | +5pp 🟢 |

**The trimming trade-off:**
- 🟢 Resonance UP (+8pp) — tighter page resonates more
- 🟢 Network believability RECOVERED (+7pp) — punchier "first it's your map" line
- 🟢 Dealbreakers DOWN to 10% — lowest yet
- 🟢 Price perception best ever — 83% fair/good_deal, only 17% too_expensive
- 🔴 Conversion DIPPED (-7pp) — some trimmed content was load-bearing
- 🔴 Intent DIPPED (-6pp) — correlated with conversion drop

**Interpretation:** The tighter page is more likeable (higher resonance, better price perception) but slightly less convincing (lower conversion). Some of the removed content — likely the specific examples (8/10 Thai place) and the "most apps die" honesty line — was contributing to conversion even though it wasn't the highest-cited. This is the classic "liked ≠ converted" pattern.

## Per-Bucket Breakdown

### taste_curator

| Metric | V1 | V2 | V3 | V2→V3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Resonance | 50% | 83% | **92%** | +9pp 🟢 |
| Conversion | 58% | 75% | **67%** | -8pp 🔴 |
| Dealbreakers | 17% | 17% | **0%** | -17pp 🟢 |

**Story:** Highest resonance yet (92%) and zero dealbreakers. The taste analytics specificity landed perfectly. But conversion dipped 8pp — likely from losing the specific examples (8/10 Thai, 4/10 tourist trap) that grounded the concept. These personas think in specific ratings and those examples proved the team "gets it." Still strong at 67%.

### social_connector

| Metric | V1 | V2 | V3 | V2→V3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Resonance | 75% | 75% | **100%** | +25pp 🟢 |
| Conversion | 50% | 75% | **67%** | -8pp 🔴 |
| Dealbreakers | 8% | 0% | **0%** | 0pp |

**Story:** 100% resonance, zero dealbreakers — the copy perfectly resonates. Conversion dipped modestly. This bucket is now at the point where product experience matters more than copy. The annual pricing strengthened their perception. Remaining questions are all product-level (invite flow, privacy controls).

### journal_graveyard

| Metric | V1 | V2 | V3 | V2→V3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Resonance | 25% | 50% | **25%** | -25pp 🔴 |
| Conversion | 17% | 42% | **33%** | -9pp 🔴 |
| Dealbreakers | 25% | 25% | **17%** | -8pp 🟢 |

**Story:** The removal of "most apps like this die after a week" hurt this bucket specifically. Multiple personas noted missing the honesty. Resonance dropped 25pp — significant regression. Conversion also dipped. The three-month testimonial partially compensates but doesn't replace the direct acknowledgment of their pattern. Dealbreakers improved, suggesting the structural concerns are being addressed even as the emotional connection weakened.

**Key learning: The honesty line was load-bearing for this bucket.** It should be restored in V4.

### fomo_scroller ⭐

| Metric | V1 | V2 | V3 | V2→V3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Resonance | 75% | 42% | **67%** | +25pp 🟢 |
| Conversion | 17% | 50% | **75%** | +25pp 🟢 |
| Dealbreakers | 17% | 17% | **17%** | 0pp |

**Story:** The biggest winner of the trimming. Conversion surged to 75% — the tighter page is dramatically better for mobile scrollers. "Choosing feels like work when you don't have a system" remains the top line. The shorter problem section concentrating both pains into one paragraph is more effective. This confirms: page length was hurting this bucket in V2.

---

### city_explorer

| Metric | V1 | V2 | V3 | V2→V3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Resonance | 67% | 50% | **58%** | +8pp |
| Conversion | 75% | 92% | **58%** | -34pp 🔴 |
| Dealbreakers | 8% | 17% | **17%** | 0pp |

**Story:** The biggest drop — 92% to 58% conversion. With 12 personas, this is going from 11/12 to 7/12 (a swing of 4 personas). Some of this may be small-sample noise, but directionally the trimming may have removed content that was specifically serving this bucket. The longer cold-start explanation in V2 may have been doing more work than the punchy one-liner. Also possible: the "first it's your map" line works better with its explanatory context than standing alone.

**Key learning: city_explorer may need the longer cold-start explanation.** The punchy version resonates but doesn't fully address their concern.

## Strongest Lines (V3)

| Line | Mentions | Trend |
|---|---|---|
| "Choosing feels like work when you don't have a system." | 6 | ⬆️ Rising — fomo_scroller anchor |
| "First it's your map. Then it's your map plus everyone you trust." | 6 | Stable — city_explorer + social anchor |
| "One tap. That's it." | 5 | Stable — journal_graveyard anchor |
| "Less mediocre. More you." | 5 | Stable — universal closer |
| "$99/year" | 3 | **NEW** — taste_curator driven |
| "See which neighborhoods you rate highest..." | 3 | **NEW** — taste analytics specificity |
| "Three months in and I still rate everything." | 3 | Stable — retention proof |
| "Their discoveries become yours." | 3 | ⬆️ Rising — network shorthand |

## Price Perception (Best Yet)

| | BL | V1 | V2 | V3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Too Expensive | 50% | 23% | 27% | **17%** |
| Fair | 40% | 60% | 45% | **50%** |
| Good Deal | 10% | 17% | 28% | **33%** |

The annual pricing option produced a significant positive shift. "Good deal" more than tripled from baseline. Multiple personas specifically cited $99/year as the anchor that made Pro feel worthwhile.

## V4 Recommendations

The V3 results reveal a clear "have your cake and eat it too" opportunity:

1. **Restore the honesty line for journal_graveyard.** "Most apps like this die after a week. We know that." was load-bearing. Put it back in the retention section. This is a targeted restore, not a length increase — the line replaces the current opening of the retention section.

2. **Restore the specific examples for taste_curator.** "Your 8/10 Thai place in the East Village. Your 4/10 tourist trap in Miami." These grounded the concept. Add them back as a single line in the solution section.

3. **Expand the cold-start explanation slightly for city_explorer.** The one-liner is punchy but the V2 explanatory version (3-4 sentences) converted at 92%. Find a middle ground — 2 sentences of context around "first it's your map."

4. **Keep the tighter problem section.** The merged fomo_scroller paragraph at its current length is driving the best fomo_scroller results yet (+25pp conversion). Don't expand this back.

5. **Keep annual pricing.** The $99/year option is the highest-impact pricing change across all rounds.

**Strategy: Selective restoration.** V4 should be V3's length with V2's high-performing content surgically restored where the data says it matters. Net length change should be ~5% longer than V3 (not back to V2 length).

## Cross-Version Trend

| Metric | BL | V1 | V2 | V3 | Peak |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Conversion | 7% | 43% | **67%** | 60% | V2 |
| Resonance | 17% | 58% | 60% | **68%** | V3 |
| Intent | 12% | 37% | **63%** | 57% | V2 |
| Network | 7% | **62%** | 55% | **62%** | V1/V3 |
| Dealbreakers | 27% | 15% | 15% | **10%** | V3 |
| Price fair+ | 50% | 77% | 73% | **83%** | V3 |

The data suggests V4 should combine V2's conversion-driving content with V3's structural improvements. The "best version" is a hybrid.
