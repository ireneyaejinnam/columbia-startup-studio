## Top-Line Metrics

| Dimension | Strongly Disagree | Disagree | Neutral | Agree | Strongly Agree | Agree+ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Resonance | 12% | 48% | 23% | 17% | 0% | **17%** |
| Intent | 20% | 38% | 30% | 12% | 0% | **12%** |
| Conversion Confidence | 27% | 50% | 17% | 7% | 0% | **7%** |
| Network Believability | 13% | 43% | 37% | 7% | 0% | **7%** |

| Dimension | Value |
|---|---|
| **Price: Too Expensive** | 50% |
| **Price: Fair** | 40% |
| **Price: Good Deal** | 10% |
| **Dealbreakers** | 27% (16/60) |

## Clarity Accuracy

| Score | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| Wrong | 2 | 3% |
| Partial | 58 | 97% |
| Nailed It | 0 | **0%** |

**Note:** Zero personas captured the core product claim (taste profile + friend network discovery). Almost all described it as "a tracking/rating app" — they understood the surface but not the differentiator. The generic copy doesn't communicate the taste profile or network discovery concepts at all.

## Per-Bucket Breakdown

### taste_curator (12 personas)
- Conversion agree+: **0%** (0/12)
- Dealbreakers: **42%** (5/12)
- Top objection theme: "No differentiation from tools I already use"
- Key signal: This bucket has the highest dealbreaker rate. They already have systems and need a strong reason to switch.

### social_connector (12 personas)
- Conversion agree+: **0%** (0/12)
- Dealbreakers: **8%** (1/12)
- Top objection theme: "Social features barely described and paywalled"
- Key signal: Low dealbreakers but zero conversion. They're open but the copy didn't give them enough to act on. The social pitch is too vague.

### journal_graveyard (12 personas)
- Conversion agree+: **0%** (0/12)
- Dealbreakers: **58%** (7/12)
- Top objection theme: "Same concept I've tried and abandoned multiple times"
- Key signal: Highest dealbreaker rate. This bucket needs explicit reassurance that this is different from past failures. Generic copy triggers their pattern recognition.

### fomo_scroller (12 personas)
- Conversion agree+: **8%** (1/12)
- Dealbreakers: **17%** (2/12)
- Top objection theme: "Tracks past experiences but doesn't help with discovery/inspiration"
- Key signal: They want forward-looking features (what to do next), not backward-looking (what you did). The copy focuses on logging, which misses their need.

### city_explorer (12 personas)
- Conversion agree+: **25%** (3/12)
- Dealbreakers: **8%** (1/12)
- Top objection theme: "No mention of how this helps in a new city"
- Key signal: Most receptive bucket — they have the strongest unmet need. Even generic copy gets partial traction because the concept itself resonates. But the copy doesn't speak to their specific situation at all.

## Top Qualitative Themes

### What Feels Off (most frequent)
1. **Fake testimonials** — mentioned across all buckets. "Nobody says 'I like using this app.'" The generic testimonials actively damage credibility.
2. **No personality / generic language** — "could describe 50 different apps," "beige wall paint of landing pages," "written by an algorithm."
3. **Social features underexplained** — three vague sentences for what should be the differentiator.
4. **The word 'log' feels like work** — multiple personas flagged "log your experience" as effortful language.
5. **Premium paywall on social** — paywalling the network feature kills adoption for social_connector and city_explorer buckets.

### Most Common Objections
1. "How is this different from [Notes/Google Maps/texting friends]?" (all buckets)
2. "Social features behind paywall = dead network" (social_connector, city_explorer)
3. "No evidence this will stick / no retention mechanism" (journal_graveyard)
4. "Tracks past but doesn't help discover future" (fomo_scroller, city_explorer)
5. "Fake testimonials destroy trust" (all buckets)

### Strongest Lines (by frequency)
1. "See what your friends have rated" — 8 mentions (mostly social_connector, city_explorer)
2. "This can help you find new things to try" — 7 mentions (fomo_scroller, city_explorer)
3. "An app to help you remember the things you do" — 5 mentions
4. "Everything is saved in one place" — 4 mentions (taste_curator, journal_graveyard)
5. "Do you ever forget what you've done?" — 3 mentions (fomo_scroller)

The friend/discovery related lines outperformed the tracking/memory lines — even in generic form, the social concept has pull.

## Baseline Calibration Summary

These are the floor scores. V1 and beyond will be measured against these:

| Metric | Baseline Floor |
|---|---|
| Conversion agree+ | 7% |
| Resonance agree+ | 17% |
| Intent agree+ | 12% |
| Network believability agree+ | 7% |
| Clarity nailed_it | 0% |
| Dealbreaker rate | 27% |
| Price too_expensive | 50% |

**Any V1 score that doesn't meaningfully beat these numbers is just AI grading generosity, not real copy improvement.**
