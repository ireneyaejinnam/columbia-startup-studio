## Problem

You've been to hundreds of places. You remember maybe twenty.

Someone texts you "where should we eat tonight?" and your mind goes blank — even though last month you had the best meal of the year and now you can't remember the name. Your Notes app is a graveyard. Your Google Maps saves are a wall of pins with no context. Your Instagram saves? Gone.

Meanwhile, you keep ending up at the same three places — or worse, scrolling "best of" lists for twenty minutes and ending up on the couch. Not because you don't want to do things. Because choosing feels like work when you don't have a system.

Your taste deserves better than this.

## Solution

One tap. That's it.

After any experience — dinner, a hike, a comedy show, a bar you stumbled into at midnight — rate it. One tap, one number. No review. No paragraph. No photo required. Rate it now, or add it later — your profile doesn't care about timestamps.

Experience Architects takes that single signal and builds your taste profile over time. Not a list. Not a journal. A living, ranked record of what you've done and what you actually thought of it.

Your 8/10 Thai place. Your 4/10 tourist trap. The 10/10 speakeasy you'd never have found alone. Searchable. Sortable. Yours.

## Network Discovery

Here's where it gets interesting.

Your friends are rating too. And their taste profiles feed yours — not through some algorithm guessing what you might like based on 50 million strangers, but through the actual people you trust.

Your friend who always finds the best dive bars? You'll see their top-rated spots in your neighborhood. The one with perfect restaurant taste? Their 9s and 10s surface when you're looking for somewhere new. That friend who just moved to your city and has been exploring nonstop? Their discoveries become yours.

Think Beli — the restaurant ranking app — but for everything. Bars, hikes, day trips, shows, classes, pop-ups.

And before your friends join? Your personal taste profile works from day one — a searchable, ranked map of everything you've experienced. First it's your map. Then it's your map plus everyone you trust.

Network-powered discovery that actually feels like getting a rec from a friend. Because it is one.

## How It Works

**Rate** — Tap to rate any experience. One number. Two seconds. Done.

**Build** — Your taste profile grows with every rating. It learns what you love, what you skip, and what you'd recommend without hesitation.

**Discover** — See what's highly rated by the people you actually trust. No strangers. No sponsored posts. Just your network's real signal.

## What Keeps You Coming Back

Most apps like this die after a week. We know that.

That's why Experience Architects is built around momentum, not effort. Weekly taste recaps show you patterns you didn't notice. Friend activity nudges pull you back when someone you trust rates something great nearby. And the more you rate, the sharper your discovery gets — your profile compounds, so month three is dramatically more useful than day one.
