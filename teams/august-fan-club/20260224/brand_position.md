## Brand Thesis

> **Life deserves evidence, not just plans.**

Most tools help people plan their life.  
Some help people remember their life.  

None help people clearly see the life they actually lived.  

This product exists to make life visible.  

Not as intentions.  
Not as fragments.  

But as evidence.

---

## Core Product Definition

> **Evidence of Life helps people see their life as it actually happened by turning plans, actions, and memories into one continuous timeline.**

---

## Existence Statement

> **Evidence of Life exists to close the gap between the life people planned and the life they actually lived.**

Plans live in planners.  
Memories live in photos.  
Reality lives nowhere.  

Until now.

---

## Target Identity

> **Evidence of Life is for someone who wants to see their life, not just manage their time.**

**Primary segment:** Students and young professionals who use Apple Calendar or Reminders and feel like weeks pass without any clear record of what actually happened.

They:

- Plan their days, but know plans change
- Take photos of moments that matter
- Want to remember their life without writing long journal entries
- Feel time passes too quickly
- Want proof that their days were real
- Are not willing to build or maintain a new tracking habit

---

## Canonical Language

- **Evidence of life**
- **See your life**
- **Plans vs reality**
- **Your life, in one timeline**
- **Proof that you lived**
- **The timeline of your life**
- **Automatic by default**
- **Private by design**

---

## Language to Avoid

- **Avoid:** productivity — **Because:** It frames the product as an efficiency tool  
- **Avoid:** task manager — **Because:** It reduces life into tasks  
- **Avoid:** note-taking — **Because:** The product is not about writing information  
- **Avoid:** journaling app — **Because:** It implies effort and writing  
- **Avoid:** second brain — **Because:** It frames the product as cognitive, not emotional  

---

## Tone Guidelines

- **Calm, not urgent** — No hustle framing  
- **Existential, not technical** — Speak about life, not features  
- **Clear, not clever** — Clarity builds trust  
- **Emotional, not sentimental** — Truthful, not exaggerated  

---

## Positioning Statement

> **For students and young professionals who feel like weeks disappear, Evidence of Life is the automatic private timeline that finally shows what actually happened — not just what was planned.**

---

## Brand Values

### Reality over intention
What actually happened matters more than what was planned.

### Effortless capture
Life should not require discipline to be remembered.

### Continuity over fragmentation
Life is continuous.
Tools should reflect that continuity.

### Privacy by design
Your life is not content.
Evidence of Life never uses your data for ads, training, or public visibility.

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Isn't this just a calendar? | Calendars show what was scheduled. This shows what actually happened. |
| Isn't this journaling? | Journaling requires writing. This works even if you never write. |
| I already use Notion or Apple Calendar. | Those tools show plans. This shows reality. |
| I don't keep journals. | You don't need to. Your life records itself here. |
| Isn't this like Instagram? | Instagram shows what you publish. This shows what you lived. |
