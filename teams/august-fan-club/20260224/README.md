### 3. Synthetic Testing
[synthetic_testing/](synthetic_testing/)

Two rounds of iteration across 10 synthetic personas drawn from user interviews.

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| [v1_copy.md](synthetic_testing/v1_copy.md) | Original landing page copy tested in round 1 |
| [v1_results.md](synthetic_testing/v1_results.md) | Feedback from 10 personas on V1 |
| [v2_copy.md](synthetic_testing/v2_copy.md) | Revised copy tested in round 2 |
| [v2_results.md](synthetic_testing/v2_results.md) | Feedback from 10 personas on V2 |

**What changed between V1 and V2:**
- Added explicit automation language ("automatic by default") — top V1 confusion was how "Actual" gets captured
- Added privacy section — 7/10 personas raised data/privacy concerns in V1
- Added "use it only when overwhelmed" framing — reduced habit maintenance anxiety
- Added integration language (calendar, photos) — addressed integration dealbreakers

**V2 topline improvement vs V1:**
- Clarity: +1 average
- Trust/privacy: +2 among privacy-sensitive personas
- Intent to try: +1 among students
- Strongest confirmed segment: overwhelmed students using Apple ecosystem
