# Evidence of Life — Landing Page Copy (V1)

---

## Hero

### Headline
Proof that you lived.

### Subheadline
Evidence of Life is a timeline that shows your life as it actually happened — combining plans, actions, and memories in one continuous view.

Most tools help you plan.
Some help you remember.
None show your life as it really unfolded.

### CTA
**Join the waitlist**

**Microcopy:**
No journaling required. No pressure to be productive.

---

## Reframe Section

### Plans are not your life.

Your calendar shows what you intended.
Your photos show fragments.
Your memory fills the gaps.

But there's no single place that shows the truth:
What your life actually was.

Evidence of Life creates that place.
A timeline of lived reality.

---

## How It Works

### One timeline. Three layers.

#### Plan
Add what you think you'll do.
Not as commitment. As intention.

#### Actual
Log what really happened.
Plans change. Reality matters more.

#### Memory
Attach photos, places, and moments.
So your days become real again.

Your life becomes visible.
Not as goals.
As evidence.

---

## Core Value Proposition

### Finally see plans vs reality

Most tools store plans.
Photos store memories.
Reality gets lost between them.

Evidence of Life shows the gap.
Not to judge yourself.
To understand yourself.

---

## Use Cases

### Remember your life without journaling
You don't need to write paragraphs.
Just live.
Your timeline builds itself.

### See how your days actually unfold
Not how you imagined.
Not how you wish.
How they truly were.

### Reconnect with your own life
Weeks don't disappear.
They remain.
Visible.

---

## Objection Handling

### Is this just a calendar?
Calendars show what was scheduled.
Evidence of Life shows what actually happened.

### Is this journaling?
Journaling requires writing.
This works even if you never write a single word.

### I already use Notion or Apple Calendar
Those tools hold plans.
This holds reality.

### Is this like Instagram?
Instagram shows what you publish.
This shows what you lived.

---

## Social Proof (Early Positioning)

Built for people who don't journal.
Designed to capture life with minimal effort.
Made to show reality, not perfection.

---

## Emotional Close

### Most days disappear.
Not because they didn't matter.
Because nothing kept them.

Evidence of Life does.

---

## Final CTA

### See your life as it actually happened.
