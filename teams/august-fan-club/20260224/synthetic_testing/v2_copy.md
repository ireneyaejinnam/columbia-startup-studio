# Evidence of Life — Landing Page Copy (V2)

## Hero

### Headline
**Proof that you lived.**

### Subheadline
Evidence of Life is a private timeline that shows your life as it actually happened — automatically combining your plans, your real activity, and your memories in one continuous view.

Most tools help you plan.  
Some help you remember.  
None show your life as it truly unfolded.

### CTA
**Join the waitlist**

**Microcopy:**  
Automatic by default. No journaling required. No pressure to be productive.

## Reframe Section

### Plans are not your life.
Your calendar shows what you intended.  
Your photos show fragments.  
Your task list shows what was supposed to happen.

But there’s no single place that shows the truth:  
**What your life actually was.**

Evidence of Life creates that place.  
A timeline built from what already exists — not from what you force yourself to write.

## How It Works

### One timeline. Three layers.

#### Plan
Your existing calendar events appear automatically.  
Not as commitments.  
As intentions.

#### Actual
Your day is reconstructed automatically — from your calendar completions, location history, and photos.
You can confirm, edit, or add something in seconds.
But you never start from a blank page.

Plans change.  
Reality matters more.

#### Memory
Photos, places, and moments connect to each day.  
So your timeline isn’t just tasks.  
It becomes context.  
Emotion.  
Proof.

Your life becomes visible.  
Not as goals.  
As evidence.

## Core Value Proposition

### Finally see plans vs reality
Most tools store plans.  
Photos store memories.  
Productivity apps store tasks.

Reality gets lost between them.

Evidence of Life shows:
- What you planned
- What actually happened
- What stayed with you

Side by side.

Not to judge yourself.  
To understand yourself.  
And to finally see where your time truly went.

## Use Cases

### Remember your life without journaling
You don’t need to write paragraphs.  
You don’t need to maintain a habit.  
Your timeline builds itself from what you already do.

### See how your days actually unfold
Not how you imagined.  
Not how you wish.  
How they truly were.

Scroll a week and instantly understand it.

### When everything is “in the list” but nothing feels finished
See what moved forward.  
See what changed.  
See what mattered most.  
Even on days that felt unproductive.

### Use it daily — or only when life gets overwhelming
You don’t have to commit to perfect tracking.  
Open it when things feel chaotic.  
Reconstruct your week in minutes.  
Regain clarity.

## Objection Handling

### Is this just a calendar?
Calendars show what was scheduled.  
Evidence of Life shows what actually happened — with memory and context attached.

### Is this journaling?
Journaling starts with a blank page.  
This starts with your life.

You can add notes if you want.  
But you never have to write.

### I already use Notion or Apple Calendar
Keep them.  
Those tools hold plans and tasks.

Evidence of Life adds a reality layer — showing the gap between intention and lived experience.  
It works with your existing calendar.  
It doesn’t replace it.

### Do I have to log everything?
No.  
Your timeline is built automatically.  
You can confirm, edit, or ignore.  
It still exists.

### What about privacy?
Your life isn’t content.

You choose what connects.  
You can export or delete anytime.  
No ads.  
No public feed.  
Built for you, not for followers.

### Is this like Instagram?
Instagram shows what you publish.  
Evidence of Life shows what you lived.  
Even the quiet parts.

---

## Social Proof (Early Positioning)
Automatic by default. Private by design.

Built for people who don’t journal.
Designed for students and busy people who feel like weeks disappear.
Made to show reality, not just intentions.
Your data stays yours — no ads, no public feed.

---

## Emotional Close
Most days disappear.  
Not because they didn’t matter.  
Because nothing kept them in one place.

Evidence of Life does.
