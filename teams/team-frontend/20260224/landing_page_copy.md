# FreeWeight  
## Stress Less. Lift More.

**Strength training shouldn’t live in five different apps.**

If you're a coach, you’re juggling Google Sheets, percentage calculators, and Slack threads just to get a week of programming out.

If you're an athlete, you're logging lifts in one place, texting your coach in another, and hoping your percentages are right.

**FreeWeight is one place to program, track, and share.**  
Built for the barbell.

**Get off the bench and under the bar.**

## The Problem

Strength training is fragmented.

- Programs in spreadsheets  
- Percentages calculated manually  
- Updates buried in group chats  
- PRs lost in Notes  
- Progress scattered across apps  

It works — until it doesn’t.

When you’re coaching 15 athletes.  
When maxes change mid-cycle.  
When someone misses a lift and the math shifts.  
When no one can see the team getting stronger.

You shouldn’t need a spreadsheet to lift weights.

## The Reframe

Endurance athletes have Strava.  
Cyclists have TrainingPeaks.  

Strength athletes have… Google Sheets.

FreeWeight gives strength training the platform it deserves.

Your numbers.  
Your team.  
Your platform.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Coaches Program Once

Build a team plan.  
Set percentages.  
Assign individualized maxes.

FreeWeight auto-calculates everything.

No duplicate spreadsheets.  
No recalculating when maxes change.  
No extra buttons.

As few buttons as possible.

---

### 2. Athletes Lift

Open the app.  
See today’s session.  
Weights are already calculated.

Log sets.  
Track PRs.  
Watch your numbers move up.

Simple on the surface.  
Serious underneath.

---

### 3. Teams Share the Work

See teammates hit PRs.  
Celebrate progress.  
Build culture around effort.

It feels like a social app — but with an edge.

No influencers.  
No vanity metrics.  
Just work.

## Built for the Barbell

FreeWeight is not:

- An all-in-one fitness tracker  
- A logging-only app  
- A $1,400 enterprise system  

It’s purpose-built for strength training.

It replaces:
- Sheets  
- Calculators  
- Slack threads  

With one clean platform.

---

## Why Not Just Use Google Sheets?

Sheets are fine when:

- You coach 3 athletes  
- Percentages never change  
- No one misses lifts  
- No one wants visibility  

But when your team grows, friction compounds.

FreeWeight does what Sheets do — minus the friction, plus the community.

---

## Why Not Volt or TeamBuildr?

Those are built for professional programs with professional budgets.

FreeWeight is open by default.

Free to start.  
Lightweight.  
Designed for college teams, clubs, and serious lifters.

---

## Why Not Strava / Strong / Hevy?

They log what you did.

FreeWeight programs what you should do.

And connects it to your coach and your team.

---

## What You’ll Feel

- Clarity before a session  
- Ownership of your numbers  
- Visible progress  
- Momentum from your team  

Strength training should feel connected.  
It should feel alive.

You should see progress go up.

---

## Raising the Bar

FreeWeight exists to give strength athletes what endurance athletes have had for years:

A unified, dedicated platform.

So coaches can coach.  
Athletes can train.  
And teams can grow together.
