# FreeWeight — V1 Landing Page Copy

## Hero

**Headline:** Stress Less. Lift More.

**Subheadline:** The strength training platform that lets coaches program, athletes track, and teams grow — all in one place.

**CTA Button:** Get Off the Bench →

## Pain Point

### Your training lives in 6 different places. It shouldn't.

Google Sheets for programming. A percentage calculator on your phone. Slack for check-ins. The Notes app for maxes. A whiteboard photo for the team plan. A group chat for PRs.

You don't need more tools. You need one that was actually built for the barbell.

## How It Works

### One place to program, track, and share.

**For Coaches:**
Write individualized programs under one umbrella plan. Set percentages off each athlete's maxes — FreeWeight does the math. Push updates to your whole team in seconds, not spreadsheets.

**For Athletes:**
See your program. Log your lifts. Track your maxes. Watch your numbers go up. All in one place, connected to your coach and your team.

**For Teams:**
A shared feed of PRs, milestones, and daily check-ins. Not a social media app — a training community where the work speaks for itself.

## Why Not [Other Tool]?

**"I already use Google Sheets."**
Sheets work until you're managing percentage math for 20 athletes across a 12-week cycle. FreeWeight does what sheets do, minus the friction, plus the community.

**"I use Strong / Hevy / Strava."**
Those are logging apps. They record what you did. FreeWeight programs what you *should* do, auto-calculates your percentages from your maxes, and connects you to your coach and team.

**"Volt / TeamBuildr already does this."**
Volt is $1,400+/year per team and built for pro programs. FreeWeight is free, lightweight, and built for everyone — from a college club team to a group of friends running 5/3/1.
