# FreeWeight — V2 Landing Page Copy

**Changes from V1:** Added "Who It's For" with solo/crew/coach tiers + beginner entry point. Changed CTA to "Start Training Free." Softened "Built for the barbell" → "Purpose-built for strength training." Led with athlete experience. Removed jargon from hero. Added product preview callout. See `copy_v1_changes.md` for full rationale.

## Hero

**Headline:** Stress Less. Lift More.

**Subheadline:** Program your training, track your progress, and train with your team — all in one place. Free forever.

**CTA Button:** Start Training Free →

---

## Pain Point

### Your training is scattered. It doesn't have to be.

A spreadsheet for your program. A calculator for percentages. A group chat for check-ins. The Notes app for your maxes. A photo of the whiteboard for today's session.

Sound familiar? FreeWeight replaces the patchwork with a single platform — purpose-built for strength training.

## Who It's For

### Whether you train alone or coach a team of 60.

**You train solo** — and you want a better system than screenshots and spreadsheets. FreeWeight tracks your maxes, calculates your percentages, and shows your progress over time.

**You train with a crew** — a few friends running a cycle together, a college club team, or a gym community. FreeWeight gives you a shared feed, PRs on the board, and everyone on the same page.

**You coach athletes** — from a handful to a full roster. Write individualized programs under one umbrella plan, push updates instantly, and see who's training and who's not.

**You're just getting started** — new to the barbell or coming from another sport. Pick a built-in program, follow the plan, and let FreeWeight handle the math. Everyone starts somewhere.

## How It Works

### One place to program, track, and share.

**Program it.** Build training blocks, set percentages off real maxes, and customize by athlete — or pick from built-in templates like 5/3/1, GZCLP, and Starting Strength. No more spreadsheet formulas.

**Track it.** Log your lifts in seconds. See your maxes, your history, your trajectory. Progress should feel good before it looks good.

**Share it.** A team feed for PRs, milestones, and daily sessions. Not clout — just the work.

## Why FreeWeight?

**vs. Google Sheets / Notes app**
Sheets work until you're managing percentages across a 12-week cycle — or sharing updates with 20 athletes. FreeWeight does what sheets do, minus the friction, plus the community.

**vs. Strong / Hevy / Strava**
Those are logging apps. They record what you did. FreeWeight programs what you should do next, auto-calculates your working weights, and connects you to your coach or training partners.

**vs. Volt / TeamBuildr / TrueCoach**
Enterprise coaching platforms start at $200+/year. FreeWeight is free and built for everyone — from a college club team to a group of friends running a training cycle.

## Social Proof

### Built by people who train.

We're competitive lifters, college athletes, and strength coaches who got tired of stitching tools together. FreeWeight is the platform we wished existed — so we built it.

**What early users told us:**

> "As few buttons to push as possible." — Club team coach

> "I want to see progress go up." — College athlete

> "Fun and easy to use, but with an edge." — Beta tester

---

## CTA

### Your numbers. Your team. Your platform.

FreeWeight is free. No trials, no tiers, no catch.

Whether you're chasing a PR or just getting started — there's a place for you here.
