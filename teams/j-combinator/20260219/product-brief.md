## The Problem

New York has endless things to do — and almost no good way to find them. So people either default to the same routine, spiral through six platforms and give up, or find out about something great the day after it ends.

**Who has this problem?**

Young professionals (22–30) living in NYC who are socially motivated but planning-fatigued. They want to do more, but the process of *finding* what to do has become a barrier to actually doing it.

**How do they currently deal with it?**

They cobble together a fragmented system: Instagram stories, Google searches, Eventbrite, word-of-mouth texts, TikTok, Beli for restaurants — constantly switching between platforms depending on what they're looking for. One interviewee described it as "kind of a mess." Another mapped out 10+ different platforms she uses depending on the category.

**How painful is it?**

Very. Across 10 interviews, decision fatigue was the single most consistent theme:

- "We just get overwhelmed and kind of give up" (#5)
- "We spent so long looking that we just gave up" (#5)
- Groups research → get paralyzed → default to the same bar again
- Users miss time-limited events entirely because they only hear about them through passive Instagram feeds

One interviewee called it **"the mental load before the fun"** (#6) — the invisible effort required just to make a plan.

## The Solution

A recommendation engine that asks what you're in the mood for and tells you what's actually worth doing — filtered by what you care about, when you're free, and how far you'll go.

**What does it do?**

You answer 3–4 quick questions (category, vibe, budget, distance). The app returns 3–5 highly relevant events or activities happening soon — not a feed of 50 options to scroll through.

**How does the user interact with it?**

Open the app → answer a few prompts → get a short list of recommendations with clear "why this fits" context → tap to see details or book.

**What makes it different?**

Existing tools either show you everything (Eventbrite, Google) or passively learn from your behavior over time (Fever, Spotify-synced apps). This product is *active* and *immediate*: tell us what you want right now, and we'll cut through the noise for you. It's a decision engine, not a feed.

## Target User

**Demographics:**  
- 22–30 years old  
- Lives in New York City (Manhattan or Brooklyn)  
- Works full-time (often in tech, finance, media, creative industries)  
- Socializes 2–4x per week  

**Defining behavior:**  
- Opens Instagram, then Google, then texts three friends, then gives up  
- Has said "I want to do something this weekend but I don't know what"  
- Defaults to the same spots because finding something new takes too long  
- Discovers events after they've already ended  

**How they describe the problem:**

> "We just get overwhelmed and kind of give up." — Sam (#5)

> "The mental load before the fun." — Ruby (#6)

> "I didn't know this thing existed." — #10

> "There's so much to do and no good way to find it." — #3, #5

> "By the time I find out about it, it's already over." — Irene (#8)

## Why Now

Three converging trends:

1. **Platform fragmentation has peaked.** Users are spread across 6+ discovery tools with no consolidation layer. The cognitive load has become a real barrier to action.

2. **Event culture is booming post-COVID.** Pop-ups, immersive experiences, rotating exhibitions, and time-limited events are everywhere — but existing platforms (built for static businesses like restaurants) don't surface ephemeral content well.

3. **Passive algorithmic feeds aren't solving the problem.** Instagram and TikTok surface events, but passively and inconsistently. Users want *intentional* weekend planning, not accidental discovery while scrolling.

## Key Interview Evidence

**Strongest quote:**
> "It's the invisible effort... The mental load before the fun." — Ruby (#6)

**Pattern (appeared in 8+ interviews):**  
Users describe researching options → getting overwhelmed → giving up → defaulting to routine. The problem is not lack of options — it's filtering overload.

**Secondary pattern — "Planner responsibility":**  
The person who suggests the plan carries social risk. If the experience is bad, it reflects on them. This creates additional pressure that makes planners hesitant to recommend anything they haven't personally validated — further reinforcing the default-to-routine cycle.

**Surprise:**  
Several users explicitly said they *don't care* about friend reviews or social feeds for event discovery. They want pure recommendations for things they didn't know existed. This shifted the product direction away from "social review app" toward "event recommendation engine."

**Current spend/effort:**  
- Users spend 20–45 minutes researching plans that often fall through  
- Some maintain elaborate manual systems (color-coded Google Maps, private "Actually Good" lists)  
- Multiple users pay for tools like ClassPass or Beli, showing willingness to pay for discovery/curation

## Open Questions

1. **Data sourcing:** Can we reliably aggregate event data across categories (pop-ups, exhibitions, classes, nightlife) in a single city? What's the minimum viable coverage to feel useful?

2. **Cold start:** How do we generate good recommendations before we know the user's preferences? What's the right onboarding flow?

3. **Retention hook:** Once someone finds an event, what brings them back next week? Is there a habit loop beyond transactional use?
