# Brand Position

**Team Name:** J Combinator  
**Date:** February 2026

**Purpose:** This is an internal document. It captures your brand's thesis, identity, and canonical language so that everything you build — landing page, copy, features, pitch — speaks with one voice. This is not marketing copy. It is a decision reference.

---

## Brand Thesis

> **New York has endless things to do and almost no good way to find them — so people either default to the same routine, spiral through a dozen scattered platforms without any luck, or find out about something great the day after it ends. We exist to bring it all together and cut through the noise: one place, a few questions, 3–5 things actually worth your time — matched to what you care about, when you're free, and how far you'll travel.**

---

## Core Product Definition

> **[Product Name] offers an integrated platform to help young professionals in NYC decide what to do by asking a few quick questions and returning 3–5 relevant recommendations.**

---

## Existence Statement

> **[Product Name] exists to eliminate the mental load before the fun — so you spend less time planning and more time doing. We exist to be the go-to place you check when you want to do something.**

---

## Target Identity

> **[Product Name] is for someone who opens Instagram, then Google, then texts three friends, then gives up and goes to the same bar again. They're not antisocial — they're exhausted by the process of finding something good. They want to do more, but the search has become a barrier to actually doing it.**

They say things like:
- "I want to do something this weekend but I don't know what"
- "I didn't even know that existed"
- "We spent so long looking that we just gave up"
- "By the time I find out about it, it's already over"

They're 22–30, living in NYC, socially motivated but planning-fatigued. They're not looking for more options — they're looking for fewer, better ones.

## Canonical Language

Use these phrases everywhere — they come directly from user interviews:

| Phrase | Source | Use it for |
|--------|--------|------------|
| "The mental load before the fun" | Ruby (#6) | Tagline territory, brand storytelling, hero copy |
| "It's kind of a mess" | #3 | Problem framing — the fragmented status quo |
| "One place for everything going on" | Internal | Positioning, value prop, app store description |
| "I didn't know this thing existed" | #10 | Value prop, push notifications, success state |
| "We just get overwhelmed and kind of give up" | Sam (#5) | Problem framing, landing page, ads |
| "What do we do this weekend?" | #9 | Onboarding prompt, empty state, search UX |
| "There's so much to do and no good way to find it" | #3, #5 | Problem statement, pitch deck, about page |
| "Things that don't last forever" | #10 | Time-limited event urgency, notifications |
| "I would do it as long as they tell me these things exist" | #10 | CTA language, onboarding promise |

---

## Language to Avoid

| Don't say | Why | Say instead |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| "Curated for you" | Overused, sounds like every newsletter | "Matched to what you actually like" |
| "Social discovery platform" | Founder-speak; no user said this | "Find things to do" |
| "Leverage your social graph" | VC pitch language | Don't reference this at all in user-facing copy |
| "Content creators" / "Influencers" | Multiple users expressed distrust (#6, #9) | "People you trust" or just skip it |
| "Algorithm" / "AI-powered" | Users want results, not tech explanations | "Gets smarter the more you use it" |
| "Never miss an event" | Triggers FOMO anxiety, which is the problem | "Know what's worth your time" |
| "All-in-one platform" | Sounds like enterprise software | "One place for everything going on" |
| "Optimize your weekend" | Hustle culture framing; users want to relax | "Spend less time planning, more time doing" |
| "Rate and review" | Post-pivot, this isn't the core action | "Tell us what you're into" |
| "Community" | Vague and overused | Be specific: "your friends," "people near you" |

---

## Tone Guidelines

- **Direct, not clever** — Say what you mean. Don't make users decode wordplay.
- **Warm, not saccharine** — Friendly and human, but not aggressively cheerful or emoji-heavy.
- **Confident, not hype-y** — We know this works. No need to oversell with superlatives.
- **Practical, not aspirational** — We solve a real weekly problem, not a lifestyle fantasy.

---

## Positioning Statement

> **For young professionals in NYC who want to do more but are exhausted by the search, [Product Name] is the event recommendation tool that cuts through the noise and gives you 3–5 things actually worth doing — filtered by what you care about, when you're free, and how far you'll go.**

### How this differs from alternatives:

| Alternative | What they do | What we do differently |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------|
| Eventbrite | Events only, still have to search elsewhere for classes, pop-ups, nightlife | We aggregate everything — one place for all categories — and show you 3-5 that match what you want |
| Google | Shows you everything, no filtering, sends you to 10 different sites | We keep you in one app from discovery to decision |
| Fever / DICE | Passive personalization, limited to their own ticketed events | We pull from everywhere and ask what you want *right now* |
| Instagram / TikTok | Accidental discovery while scrolling, scattered across accounts | Intentional planning in one unified experience |
| Beli | Social reviews for restaurants only | Cross-category event recommendations, not reviews |

**The core insight:** Users currently bounce between 6+ platforms depending on what they're looking for. We bring it all together so they never have to leave.

---

## Brand Values

These are tiebreakers when the team disagrees:

- **One place, not one more place** — We're replacing the six-app spiral, not adding to it. If a feature makes users leave our app to complete a task, we've failed.

- **Fewer, better** — We'd rather show 3 great options than 30 mediocre ones. If we can't confidently recommend it, we don't show it.

- **Respect their time** — Every tap, every screen, every notification should be worth it. If it doesn't help them decide, cut it.

- **Discovery over validation** — We're not here to confirm what they already know. We're here to surface what they didn't know existed.

---

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "How is this different from Fever or Eventbrite?" | Those apps only show their own inventory and make you scroll through everything. We aggregate across sources — concerts, classes, pop-ups, nightlife — and filter it down to 3–5 options that actually match what you want. One app instead of six. |
| "What if the recommendations aren't good?" | We filter by what you care about — category, vibe, budget, distance. The more you use it, the better it gets. But even on day one, we're narrowing thousands of options down to a handful worth your time. |
| "I just ask my friends for recommendations." | That works when you know what you want. We're for when you don't — when you want to do *something* this weekend but have no idea what. We surface things your friends might not know about either, because we're pulling from everywhere. |
| "I don't want another app to check." | That's exactly the point — we're not another app to add to the pile. We're the one app that replaces the six you currently bounce between. Open us Thursday or Friday, get your answer, done. |

## Key Interview Language

The 5 most vivid phrases that should shape all copy:

1. **"The mental load before the fun."** — Ruby (#6), describing the invisible effort of filtering and choosing
2. **"We just get overwhelmed and kind of give up."** — Sam (#5), on research paralysis leading to routine
3. **"I didn't know this thing existed."** — #10, the core discovery moment we're enabling
4. **"By the time I find out about it, it's already over."** — Irene (#8), on missing time-limited events
5. **"It's kind of a mess."** — #3, on the current fragmented discovery process

---

## User Archetypes (for UX Testing)

When building features or testing copy, ground decisions in these real archetypes from interviews:

| Archetype | Based on | Core need | Key filter preferences |
|-----------|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| The Overwhelmed Planner | Sam (#5), Sunjana (#1) | Reduce decision fatigue for the group | Category, budget, group-friendly |
| The Quiet Explorer | #9 (JP Morgan), Ruby (#6) | Discover niche/non-obvious things without social media | Category (hobbies, classes), distance, vibe (low-key) |
| The Culture Seeker | #10 (hedge fund) | Find time-limited art/culture events before they end | Category (exhibitions, pop-ups), date range, "ending soon" |
| The Routine Breaker | #2 (paralegal), #8 (Netflix) | Escape the same-bar-every-weekend loop | "New this week," "never tried," surprise/random |
| The Budget-Conscious Socializer | Maddie (#4) | Find genuinely good free/cheap things to do | Price filter (free, under $20), quality signal |

---

## The Pivot (Context)

The interviews surfaced two distinct user needs:

1. **"Help me filter what I already know exists"** → social proof, friend reviews, ratings (the old direction)
2. **"Tell me what exists that I don't know about"** → event discovery, smart filtering, timeliness (the new direction)

**We pivoted toward #2.** The strongest signals supported this:

- #10 (emotional intensity: 8) wanted pure discovery of pop-ups, exhibitions, and time-limited events — didn't care about friend reviews
- #5 (emotional intensity: 8) described research paralysis so severe the group just stays home
- #8 identified the timing gap — reviews are useless for one-off events that are already over
- #9 wanted niche hobby recommendations (knitting classes, crafts) that no social feed would surface

**The core product promise is now:** You tell us what you're into, and we tell you what's happening — pulling from everywhere so you don't have to. Three to five options. Not a feed. Not a social network. Not another platform to add to the pile. A single, integrated decision engine that respects your time.
