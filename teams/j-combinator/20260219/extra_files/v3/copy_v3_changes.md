# Changes from V2 → V3

## Example Cards — Full Replacement
**Change:** Kehinde Wiley (Sean Kelly) + Nublu jazz + Fort Tryon park walk → "Stitched Futures" Bronx textile show + Taiwanese pop-up dinner + site-specific theater (Navy Yard)
**Why:** Culture_seeker and quiet_explorer objections converged on the same critique: "these examples aren't proof of discovery — they're curated versions of things I could find myself." Raj Patel (quiet_explorer): "The Kehinde Wiley example is well-known. None of these feel like things I wouldn't have found myself." The new examples are: genuinely obscure (emerging Bronx artists not in major galleries), a food pop-up with real scarcity signals (sells out Wednesday, $12), and site-specific theater not on Eventbrite. The third card explicitly includes "Not on Eventbrite" — a direct proof-of-differentiation statement. The park walk (Fort Tryon) was called out by Isabel Torres as "not really curated — parks are free by default." Replaced with a genuinely curated free cultural event.

## New Section: "How We Decide What's Worth Your Time"
**Change:** Added a transparent editorial/curation explanation section between How It Works and Social Proof
**Why:** The single most consistent quiet_explorer objection across V2: "We filter for quality" is a promise, not a feature. Adrienne Cole (UX researcher): "What does quality mean? Who defines it?" Andre Williams: "The gap between input and output is still a black box." Diana Tran: "I trust people, not apps. What makes this reliable?" This section directly answers the three questions they're actually asking: where do you source events (beyond Eventbrite), what's your quality bar (explicit criteria), and how does personalization work (behavioral skip/save signals, not social graph). It's written in plain factual language, not marketing copy — which is exactly what high-skepticism personas need.

## Example Cards — Sub-$10 Card Added
**Change:** The pop-up dinner is $12 (just above $10) and the theater is $10. Previous V2 cards showed a $15 jazz residency as the only paid example.
**Why:** Budget_conscious_socializer requested sub-$10 examples in V2. Carlos Mendez: "Show me an under-$10 example card." Hannah Kim: "Show me a paid event card that's actually in my range." The $10 theater card and $12 pop-up card now demonstrate the under-$10/under-$20 tiers with concrete examples.

## CTA — "Free to get started" added
**Change:** Added "Free to get started. No account required to browse your first shortlist." as the opening line of the CTA body.
**Why:** 10 of 12 budget_conscious_socializer personas asked "Is the app free?" as their #1 unanswered question. This was the most consistent gap in V2. Jasmine Wright: "If the app costs money, I can't use it." Leah Goldstein: "If quality recs are paywalled, this isn't for me." Stating it explicitly removes the question entirely. "No account required to browse" also addresses quiet_explorer's lingering hesitation about commitment.

## CTA Button Copy
**Change:** "Get early access →" → "Get your first shortlist →"
**Why:** "Early access" frames a wait. "Get your first shortlist" implies immediate value and is more concrete. Cross-bucket signal from V2: multiple personas wanted to know what happens after they sign up. The new button copy answers that implicitly. Also echoes the product's core promise (shortlist) rather than its business state (early access).

## CTA Subtext — 48-hour promise
**Change:** Added "We'll send your first shortlist within 48 hours."
**Why:** Ben Shapiro-Stein (quiet_explorer): "I don't sign up for things that aren't ready. The early access framing is slightly concerning." Tara Patel: "I don't want to give my email to something that might not launch." The 48-hour promise makes early access feel real and immediate rather than indefinite. It's a commitment that builds trust with skeptics.

## Step 3 — Sharing callout
**Change:** Added "Share it with your group chat or keep it to yourself." to Step 3.
**Why:** Group/sharing was mentioned by 10+ personas across two buckets in V2 as an unanswered question. Gabrielle Moreau (routine_breaker): "If I can't send this to my group chat, it loses half its value." Lucia Ferraro (overwhelmed_planner): "Can multiple people take the quiz?" One sentence directly acknowledges the group use case without implying a full feature build.

## Categories — Expanded in Step 1
**Change:** Added "photography shows, design talks" to the category list in Step 1
**Why:** Sofia Reyes (culture_seeker, architect) and Priya Nair (photographer) both flagged that their professional interest categories were invisible in the V2 list. Adding niche creative categories signals depth of coverage to culture_seeker and quiet_explorer personas who have specific, developed interests.

## Objection: "Will you have the niche stuff"
**Change:** Added "and the example cards above are typical, not cherry-picked"
**Why:** Culture_seekers were enthusiastic about the promise but skeptical the examples were representative. Adding "typical, not cherry-picked" directly addresses the concern that the examples are marketing artifacts rather than real product output.

## "Actively building" language softened
**Change:** "We're actively building" (V2) → "We're in early access" (V3) + 48-hour promise
**Why:** Ben Shapiro-Stein (quiet_explorer, skepticism 5): "The 'we're actively building' makes me feel like I'm signing up for something incomplete." "Early access" implies a live product being expanded, not a product under construction.
