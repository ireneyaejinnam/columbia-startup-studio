# Changes from V3 → V4

## "How We Decide" — Restructured to Lead/Expand Format
**Change:** Replaced the full 3-paragraph "How We Decide" section with a 2-sentence lead + 3 scannable bullets. The full detail moves into a tighter format that can be read in 20 seconds instead of 60.
**Why:** 7 personas across overwhelmed_planner and routine_breaker flagged this as page-flow friction — they were already sold by the example cards and the section slowed them down. Chloe Bernstein: "By the time I get to it, I've already decided." Liam O'Brien: "I'd have signed up before reaching it." Natasha Ivanova: "The people who need it most (skeptics) are also most likely to be put off by a wall of explanation." The section is essential for quiet_explorers but needs to not penalize fast-converting segments. Tightening to bullets preserves the signal while reducing reading time by ~60%.

## Editorial Identity — One Line Added
**Change:** Added "Curated by a small team of New Yorkers who use this product themselves." to the "How We Decide" section header.
**Why:** Raj Patel (quiet_explorer, last remaining neutral): "The sourcing is credible but taste alignment remains unproven." Ben Shapiro-Stein: "I still worry this is a team of 2 people who can't scale this manually." Both objections are partially about human credibility. "A small team of New Yorkers who use this product themselves" addresses taste alignment (they're locals with skin in the game) while being honest about scale. It doesn't overclaim (no "expert curators" language) and doesn't underclaim (not "an algorithm").

## Example Cards — Geographically Anchored
**Change:** All three example cards are now set in Brooklyn, with explicit proximity signals that make geographic filtering feel real. Bronx textile show → Brooklyn-based artist pop-up (Bushwick); Crown Heights Taiwanese pop-up stays; Navy Yard theater → Red Hook site-specific theater. Distance labels changed from abstract ("0.8 mi from you") to a from-Brooklyn frame.
**Why:** 7+ personas across routine_breaker, budget_conscious_socializer, and quiet_explorer flagged geographic scatter: three cards spanning the Bronx, Crown Heights, and Brooklyn Navy Yard didn't feel like a real shortlist for a single user. Elena Petrov: "Crown Heights pop-up isn't near Harlem. Does the distance filter actually work?" Jamal Carter: "The shortlist needs to be geographically coherent." David Kim: "A free event in the Bronx isn't useful if I'm in SoHo." A Brooklyn-anchored shortlist demonstrates coherent proximity filtering while being plausible for the largest NYC audience segment.

## Free Tier — Scope Clarified
**Change:** Changed "Free to get started" → "Free to use. Full shortlist, no features locked." in the CTA section.
**Why:** 3 budget_conscious_socializer personas (Leah Goldstein, Maya Chen, Isabel Torres) asked explicitly: "Is the free tier full-featured or limited?" "Free to get started" implies a freemium ladder where the good stuff is paywalled. "Free to use. Full shortlist, no features locked." removes the ambiguity entirely and is the most direct response to a concrete unanswered question.

## "Instagram Accounts" Sourcing Clarification
**Change:** Changed "artist Instagram accounts" → "artist and organizer social accounts" in the sourcing list.
**Why:** Marcus Thompson (routine_breaker, bartender): "The sourcing section names 'artist Instagram accounts' — so they do use Instagram, just not your social profile. That distinction could be clearer." Removing the specific Instagram reference avoids the confusion between "we monitor Instagram for events" (fine) and "we use your Instagram profile" (not fine). "Social accounts" is accurate and avoids the name-brand confusion.

## CTA Button
**Change:** "Get your first shortlist →" remains. Subtext updated: "Tell us your neighborhood and we'll send your first shortlist within 48 hours — full recommendations, no credit card."
**Why:** "No credit card" directly reinforces the free-tier clarity and removes any remaining friction for budget-conscious personas. "Tell us your neighborhood" makes the 48-hour promise feel more credible — it signals there's a real intake process, not just an email capture.
