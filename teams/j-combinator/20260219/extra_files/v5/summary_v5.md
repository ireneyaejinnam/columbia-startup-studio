## V5 Validation: What the Final Round Confirmed

V5 was the minimum-5-round compliance round with two minor polish changes tested: (1) swapping one evening example card for a daytime fermentation workshop explicitly labelled "low-key, solo-friendly," and (2) adding "mornings, evenings, weekdays, or weekends" to the schedule filter in Step 2.

**Both changes were net positive with zero tradeoffs:**

The **daytime card** was well-received across four separate persona threads that had flagged all-evening examples across prior rounds:
- Morgan Reilly (routine_breaker): "The fermentation workshop at Prospect Park on Saturday morning is exactly what I was asking for... Both of my persistent objections are addressed."
- Fatima Al-Hassan (routine_breaker): "First time an example card has acknowledged the solo use case."
- Kira Johansson (quiet_explorer): "The fermentation workshop card has 'low-key, solo-friendly' explicitly labelled... This directly addresses my persistent objection."
- Sade Adeyemi (quiet_explorer): "Better than V4 for me specifically."

The **mornings/weekdays filter** closed the only remaining gap for Amira Khalil (routine_breaker, irregular schedule, spin instructor): "The mornings/weekdays addition directly addresses my V2 question about irregular schedules. This is the first version that makes me feel like a primary use case."

**No negative tradeoffs were observed.** The personas who had liked the Taiwanese pop-up dinner card (especially budget_conscious_socializer) showed no decline. Culture_seekers were neutral to the swap — the art show and theater cards carried their satisfaction.

One new minor signal surfaced: Marcus Thompson (routine_breaker) questioned whether the fermentation workshop was "free to attend or free but pay for tastings." This is a product-accuracy concern, not a copy problem, but worth noting for implementation.

## Stopping Criteria — Final

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Minimum 5 rounds completed | ✅ |
| >50% conversion agree+ for 2+ consecutive rounds | ✅ V4 and V5 both 100% |
| Zero dealbreakers for 2+ consecutive rounds | ✅ V2 through V5 |
| Qualitative convergence | ✅ Residual feedback is implementation and product-level, not copy |
| V4→V5 delta | ✅ Zero movement across all metrics and all buckets |

**All stopping criteria met. Testing is complete.**

## The V5 Copy — What to Ship

The copy to ship is **V5**, which incorporates the daytime card and mornings/weekdays filter language on top of V4's foundation. It is the only version that addresses all five remaining residual gaps from V4 (daytime events, morning filter, solo-friendly example card) with zero negative tradeoffs.

## Five-Round Learning Arc

| Round | Conv | What moved the needle |
|-------|------|-----------------------|
| **V1** | 28% | Baseline — clear copy, wrong hero for half the audience, no product proof |
| **V2** | 77% | Hero reframe ("same place again") · Obscure example cards · "Real budgets" language |
| **V3** | 97% | Sourcing transparency section · Genuinely hard-to-find examples · "Free to get started" |
| **V4** | 100% | Team identity line · Bullet format · Geo-anchored shortlist · Free tier clarity |
| **V5** | 100% | Daytime card · Morning filter · Solo-friendly label — polish confirmed, no regression |

### The four structural changes that went from 28% to 100%:

1. **Frame the outcome, not the behavior** (V2 hero) — "Stop ending up at the same place again" hits the felt experience; "stop scrolling six apps" misses the half of the audience who aren't searching at all.

2. **Show the product, specifically** (V2 + V3 example cards) — Three obscure, genuinely hard-to-find examples beat one mainstream card. "Not on Eventbrite" is the single highest-conviction proof statement in the entire page.

3. **Explain the mechanism, plainly** (V3 sourcing section) — "We filter for quality" is a promise. "Gallery mailing lists, community boards, local organizer networks" is a methodology. Skeptics convert on methodology, not promises.

4. **Make the team human** (V4 team line) — "Curated by a small team of New Yorkers who use this product themselves" is the one line that converts the hardest-to-convert archetype: the person who trusts people, not apps.

## What Remains (Post-Testing)

These items appeared consistently across the five rounds but cannot be addressed by copy alone:

**Product-level gaps:**
- Couple/date use case — 4+ personas per round. A filter, a use-case card, or a dedicated framing in Step 1 would address this.
- Film events — Yara Nazari (culture_seeker) across all 5 rounds. A category addition to the intake quiz.
- Solo-friendly filter depth — visible in the product, not just the copy.
- Free tier limitations — "full shortlist, no features locked" is the right copy; the product needs to deliver on it.

**Implementation warning:**
- Scarcity signals ("6 remaining tickets") were flagged as potentially manufactured by Jenna Liu across V3, V4, and V5. These must be accurate in the live product or they will erode the trust the copy built.
- The fermentation workshop free card needs to be genuinely free with no hidden paid components (Marcus Thompson's V5 note).
