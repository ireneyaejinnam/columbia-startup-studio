# Changes from V4 → V5

## Purpose of This Round
V5 is the minimum-5-round compliance round. The copy reached 100% conversion in V4. The goal here is not to improve the numbers — it's to confirm stability, test two small remaining polish items, and establish that the copy has genuinely converged rather than lucked into a ceiling.

Two minor changes are being tested. Both address residual observations from V4 that were cited by 3+ personas. Neither is expected to produce meaningful metric movement.

## Change 1: Swap one example card for a daytime option
**Change:** The 7:30pm Taiwanese pop-up dinner → replaced with a daytime Saturday farmers market + cooking demo (Brooklyn, free, morning slot). The theater card and art show card remain.
**Why:** Morgan Reilly (routine_breaker) cited all-evening example cards across V3 and V4: "I want daytime and morning options." Fatima Al-Hassan flagged solo-friendly events not being shown. A morning/daytime card with a low-key vibe serves both observations simultaneously. If this change is neutral-to-positive without hurting other buckets, it stays. If it hurts culture_seeker or budget_conscious_socializer who liked the pop-up dinner, we note the tradeoff.

## Change 2: Add "including mornings and weekdays" to Step 2
**Change:** Added "including mornings and weekdays" to the "When are you free?" filter description.
**Why:** Amira Khalil (routine_breaker, spin instructor) asked in V2: "Does 'when are you free' handle any day of the week?" This was never directly addressed. Morgan Reilly raised the same concern. One phrase makes the filter's scope explicit without restructuring the section.

## What is NOT changing
Everything else in V4 is performing at ceiling. The hero, the "How We Decide" bullets, the team line, the geo-anchored shortlist frame, the free-tier language, the CTA — all stay verbatim. The job of V5 is validation, not iteration.
