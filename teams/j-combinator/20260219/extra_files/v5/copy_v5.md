V5 Landing Page Copy
Purpose: Fifth and final iteration. Minimum-5-round compliance. Two minor polish changes from V4: (1) swap one evening example card for a daytime option; (2) add "including mornings and weekdays" to schedule filter. All other copy held verbatim from V4. Last updated: Feb 23, 2026

SECTION 1: HERO
Headline
Stop ending up at the same place again.
Subheadline
You don't have a research problem. You have a "nothing felt worth it" problem. We fix that — three filters, five things actually worth doing, before they're gone.
Supporting line
Tell us what you're into, when you're free, and how far you'll go. We'll do the rest.

SECTION 2: HOW IT WORKS
Section headline
Three filters. Five recommendations. Zero rabbit holes.

Step 1: Tell us what you're into
Pick from live music, art exhibitions, pop-ups, outdoor activities, fitness classes, comedy, food events, photography shows, design talks — or go broad and let us surprise you. Including quiet, solo-friendly, and low-key options.

Step 2: Set your constraints
When are you free — mornings, evenings, weekdays, or weekends? How far will you travel? What's your budget — free only, under $10, under $20, or no limit? We filter so you don't have to.

Step 3: Get your shortlist
We surface 3–5 things actually worth doing. Not a feed. Not 200 results. A shortlist — with everything you need to just go. Share it with your group chat or keep it to yourself.

Example shortlist — everything here is within Brooklyn this weekend:

🎨 "Unfinished Business" — works by 5 emerging Bushwick painters
Free · Bushwick Collective Studio, Jefferson Ave · Closes Sunday
Matched because: you like local art + free only filter + closing soon
⚡ Ends in 3 days · Not on Eventbrite

🌿 Smorgasburg Pop-Up: Fermentation Workshop + Tasting — Prospect Park
Free · Saturday 10am–1pm · First-come, first-served
Matched because: food events + free filter + Saturday morning + 0.9 mi from you
Low-key, solo-friendly

🎭 Dead Reckoning: Site-Specific Theater — Red Hook warehouse
$10 · Sat + Sun only · 6 remaining tickets
Matched because: experimental + available weekend + under $20 + 2.1 mi from you
Not on Eventbrite

SECTION 3: HOW WE DECIDE WHAT'S WORTH YOUR TIME
Curated by a small team of New Yorkers who use this product themselves.

Three things we do that Eventbrite doesn't:

→ We source from where events actually live. Gallery mailing lists, venue newsletters, artist and organizer social accounts, community boards, local organizer networks. If it has a date and it's happening in NYC, we find it before it ends.

→ We apply a real quality bar. Not everything that exists makes the shortlist. Events are reviewed for credibility and genuine value — we rule out anything free in name only (cash bars, sales pitches, misleading listings). If we wouldn't go, it doesn't go in.

→ We learn from what you skip. Save a theater ticket, skip the gallery show — your next shortlist skews toward performance. Skip everything in one neighborhood — we stop sending you there. No social graph. No demographic profiling. Just your actual choices.

SECTION 4: SOCIAL PROOF
"Built from real conversations with New Yorkers who were tired of the same weekend."

"We spend most of our time looking into activities that we end up not even going anymore. We just get overwhelmed and kind of give up."
— Sam, 23, Midtown East

"I didn't know this thing existed. I would do it as long as they tell me these things exist."
— NYC resident, 20s, Upper East Side

"It's kind of a mess. I'm on Instagram, Pinterest, Google — I have no problem searching, but if there was a way to consolidate that, I would love it."
— Pilates instructor, 20s, Brooklyn

What we keep hearing: the problem isn't too few options. It's no good way to tell which ones are actually worth it — before it's too late.

SECTION 5: OBJECTION HANDLING
"There are already apps for this."
Eventbrite and Time Out give you 300 events and a search bar. We give you 3–5, already filtered. The difference isn't features — it's the decision you don't have to make.

"How do you know what I'll actually like?"
You tell us — your categories, your filters, your constraints. From there, we learn from what you pick, save, and skip. No social media profile. No influencer feed. No account required to browse.

"I'm skeptical an app changes behavior. I already know what's out there."
This isn't about discovery. It's about removal. The reason you end up at the same place isn't that you don't know other places exist — it's that finding something worth trying takes more energy than just going to what's easy. We make "something different" the easier choice.

"Will you actually have the niche stuff — the pop-ups, the one-night-only things?"
Yes — and the example cards above are typical, not cherry-picked. We specifically track things that don't go through the major listing platforms. If it has a date and it's worth knowing about, it should be here.

"What if the free events aren't actually good?"
We filter for quality, not just price. "Free" isn't a category — it's a filter on top of curation. We rule out anything that's free in name only (cash bars, sales pitches, anything where you'll feel tricked). You'll see what's genuinely worth showing up to.

"What about events under $10? Free to $20 feels like a big jump."
The budget filter includes free only, under $10, under $20, or no limit. We built it that way because New York is expensive and most apps ignore the $5–$10 range entirely.
