SECTION 1: HERO
Headline
Stop ending up at the same place again.
Subheadline
You don't have a research problem. You have a "nothing felt worth it" problem. We fix that — three filters, five things actually worth doing, before they're gone.
Supporting line
Tell us what you're into, when you're free, and how far you'll go. We'll do the rest.

SECTION 2: HOW IT WORKS
Section headline
Three filters. Five recommendations. Zero rabbit holes.
Step 1: Tell us what you're into
Pick from live music, art exhibitions, pop-ups, outdoor activities, fitness classes, comedy, food events, or go broad and let us surprise you. Including quiet, solo-friendly, and low-key options.
Step 2: Set your constraints
When are you free? How far will you travel? What's your budget — free only, under $10, under $20, or no limit? We filter so you don't have to.
Step 3: Get your shortlist
We surface 3–5 things actually worth doing. Not a feed. Not 200 results. A shortlist — with everything you need to just go.

Example shortlist (this is what it looks like):

🎨 Kehinde Wiley: New Portraits — Sean Kelly Gallery
Free · Chelsea · Open through March 8
Matched because: you like immersive art + free Saturday + 12 min away
⚡ Ends in 17 days

🎸 Ongoing: Monthly Jazz Residency — Nublu
$15 · East Village · Every Thursday, 9pm
Matched because: you like live music + available Thursday + 0.4 mi away

🌿 Fort Tryon Park Cherry Blossom Preview Walk — Parks Dept.
Free · Washington Heights · This weekend only
Matched because: outdoors + free only filter + near you

SECTION 3: SOCIAL PROOF
Section headline
Built from real conversations with New Yorkers who were tired of the same weekend.

"We spend most of our time looking into activities that we end up not even going anymore. We just get overwhelmed and kind of give up."
— Sam, 23, Midtown East

"I didn't know this thing existed. I would do it as long as they tell me these things exist."
— NYC resident, 20s, Upper East Side

"It's kind of a mess. I'm on Instagram, Pinterest, Google — I have no problem searching, but if there was a way to consolidate that, I would love it."
— Pilates instructor, 20s, Brooklyn

What we heard across 50+ conversations:
The #1 problem wasn't too few options. It was too many bad ones — and no way to tell which were worth it before it was too late.

SECTION 4: OBJECTION HANDLING
"There are already apps for this."
Eventbrite and Time Out give you 300 events and a search bar. We give you 3–5, already filtered. The difference isn't features — it's the decision you don't have to make.

"How do you know what I'll actually like?"
You tell us — not through a quiz, just your categories and filters. From there, we track what you pick, skip, and save. No social media profile. No influencer feed. No account required to browse.

"I'm skeptical an app changes behavior. I already know what's out there."
This isn't about discovery. It's about removal. The reason you end up at the same place isn't that you don't know other places exist — it's that finding something worth trying takes more energy than just going to what's easy. We make "something different" the easier choice.

"Will you actually have the niche stuff — the pop-ups, the one-night-only things?"
That's the whole point. The events you find out about the day after they end? We surface those. Sample sales, limited-run shows, neighborhood pop-ups, gallery openings — if it has a date and it's worth knowing about, it should be here.

"What if the free events aren't actually good?"
We filter for quality. Not everything free is worth your time, and we know it. "Free" isn't a category — it's a filter on top of quality. You'll see what's genuinely worth showing up to, not just what costs $0.

"What about events under $10? Free to $20 feels like a big jump."
You're right. The budget filter includes: free only, under $10, under $20, or no limit. We're building this for New York, which means we're building it for people with real budgets.

SECTION 5: CTA

Your weekend shouldn't take longer to plan than to enjoy.
