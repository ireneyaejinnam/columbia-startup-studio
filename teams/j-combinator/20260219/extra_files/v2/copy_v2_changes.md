# Changes from V1 → V2

## Hero Headline
**Change:** "Stop scrolling six apps just to figure out what to do this weekend." → "Stop ending up at the same place again."
**Why:** V1 data showed routine_breaker (58% resonance, 17% conversion) consistently flagged the scrolling-six-apps framing as not matching their behavior. Multiple personas said "I don't search six apps — I just go where my friends go." The new headline targets the outcome (same bar again) rather than the behavior (research), which captures both the overwhelmed_planner AND the routine_breaker who doesn't research at all. 8/12 routine_breakers cited the hero as the weakest section.

## Hero Subheadline
**Change:** "You don't need more options. You need the right 3–5…" → "You don't have a research problem. You have a 'nothing felt worth it' problem."
**Why:** routine_breaker qualitative signal: "The entire framing assumes my problem is too many options. My problem is too little motivation." This reframe names their actual problem without requiring them to self-identify as a researcher. Keeps the 3-5 shortlist promise.

## How It Works — Step 1
**Change:** Added "Including quiet, solo-friendly, and low-key options."
**Why:** quiet_explorer's #1 dealbreaker was "If the categories don't include quiet, solo, or low-key activities, this isn't for me." This single sentence directly addresses their core concern without restructuring the section.

## How It Works — Budget Filter
**Change:** "free only, under $20, or no limit" → "free only, under $10, under $20, or no limit"
**Why:** budget_conscious_socializer qualitative signal across 4+ personas: "The budget tiers are wrong. $5-$10 is my actual sweet spot. The jump from free to $20 is too big." Also directly addresses the dealbreaker around affordability for upper Manhattan / outer borough personas. Added a dedicated objection handler for this.

## Example Cards (How It Works)
**Change:** Single Kehinde Wiley card → three-card shortlist showing variety (free art / paid music / free outdoor)
**Why:** culture_seeker's #1 objection was "The example card is good but I want to see 3-5 cards, not one. Show me the actual shortlist experience." Also addresses budget_conscious_socializer who wanted to see what a paid event card looks like. Third card (Washington Heights) signals outer-borough coverage, addressing the dealbreaker from 2+ budget_conscious_socializer personas who live uptown.

## Social Proof
**Change:** Removed "87% of people we interviewed" and "6 out of 10" stats
**Why:** These were flagged as the weakest element across all buckets. overwhelmed_planner: "stats feel made up — 50 people isn't a real stat." quiet_explorer: "I would never cite percentages from n=50." Replaced with one plain sentence about what we heard, which is honest and doesn't make pseudo-scientific claims.

## Objection: "How do you know what I'll like?"
**Change:** Added "No account required to browse."
**Why:** quiet_explorer dealbreaker pattern: privacy and transparency concerns. "Gets sharper" language retained but "no account required" directly addresses the trust gap.

## New Objection: Behavior change skepticism
**Change:** Added entirely new objection handler: "I'm skeptical an app changes behavior."
**Why:** routine_breaker signal: "I know what's out there — I just default to easy. Will this push me, or just organize what I already ignore?" This objection appeared in 4/12 routine_breaker responses and none of the V1 copy addressed it. The reframe ("it's about removal, not discovery") targets their actual barrier.

## New Objection: Under $10 budget tier
**Change:** New objection handler added for the $10 price point
**Why:** budget_conscious_socializer signal across multiple personas. Also signals that we heard them, which is itself a trust signal for this segment.

## CTA
**Change:** "Join the waitlist" → "Get early access" + "Not a 'join and wait'" framing
**Why:** Cross-bucket signal: "A waitlist with no timeline feels like it might never happen." overwhelmed_planner: "A waitlist for what, exactly?" The new framing implies active progress, a small existing group, and immediate utility — all of which address the "passive waitlist" dealbreaker pattern.

## Quick-Qualify Options
**Change:** Category-based options → problem/need-based options
**Why:** The V1 options (live music, art, etc.) duplicate the Step 1 filter and add no new signal. The V2 options surface unmet needs (outer borough coverage, budget tier, solo-friendly) that inform product prioritization and segment understanding.
