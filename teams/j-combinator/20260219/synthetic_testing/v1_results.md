## Top-Line Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | V1 | Delta |
|--------|----------|-----|-------|
| Resonance (agree+) | 15.0% | 70.0% | **+55pp** |
| Intent (agree+) | 15.0% | 56.7% | **+42pp** |
| Conversion confidence (agree+) | 6.7% | 56.7% | **+50pp** |
| Dealbreaker rate | 43.3% | 23.3% | **-20pp** |
| Clarity: nailed_it | 0.0% | 65.0% | **+65pp** |

V1 dramatically outperforms the generic baseline on every dimension. The copy is communicating clearly and resonating emotionally. Conversion already exceeds the 50% threshold at V1, but there's significant bucket-level variance worth addressing.

## Per-Bucket Breakdown

| Bucket | Resonance | Intent | Conversion | Dealbreakers | Signal |
|--------|-----------|--------|------------|--------------|--------|
| overwhelmed_planner | 75% | 83% | **75%** | 8% | 🟢 Strongest performer |
| culture_seeker | **92%** | 75% | 58% | 17% | 🟢 High resonance, trust gap |
| routine_breaker | 58% | 42% | 67% | 33% | 🟡 Conversion OK, intent lagging |
| budget_conscious_socializer | 67% | 58% | 58% | 8% | 🟢 Solid, low dealbreakers |
| quiet_explorer | 58% | 25% | **25%** | **50%** | 🔴 Highest friction segment |

### Key findings per bucket:

**Overwhelmed Planners (75% conversion):** The copy was built for them and it shows. "Three filters. Five recommendations. Zero rabbit holes" is the most-cited strongest line. Hero headline ("Stop scrolling six apps") is an immediate hook. Main gap: no group planning features mentioned — this segment plans for groups, not solo.

**Culture Seekers (92% resonance, 58% conversion):** Highest resonance of any bucket. The example card with "Ends in 17 days" and the niche coverage objection handler land perfectly. But there's a resonance-conversion gap: they love the promise but don't fully trust the catalog is real. One example card isn't enough proof of depth.

**Routine Breakers (67% conversion, 42% intent):** Interesting pattern — conversion is decent but intent is the lowest after quiet_explorer. The copy names a problem they only half-feel. "Let us surprise you" resonates but the overall framing assumes heavy research behavior they don't have. They need copy that says "you don't have a research problem, you have a novelty problem."

**Budget-Conscious Socializers (58% conversion, 8% dealbreakers):** Solid performance with very low dealbreakers. The free events objection handler resonates. Main gap: budget filters feel like an afterthought rather than a core feature, and no social proof quotes mention cost. This segment feels slightly invisible in the current copy.

**Quiet Explorers (25% conversion, 50% dealbreakers):** 🔴 This is the problem segment. They resonate with the anti-algorithm messaging ("No social media profile required") but hit hard on: (1) lack of transparency about how recommendations work, (2) "gets sharper" claim feels like a black box, (3) skepticism about quality definition. Half marked dealbreaker, mostly around trust and privacy.

## Clarity Scoring

| Score | Count | Pct |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Nailed it | 39 | 65% |
| Partial | 21 | 35% |
| Wrong | 0 | 0% |

Zero personas fundamentally misunderstood the product. The "partial" responses typically captured "NYC activity app" but missed the "small curated shortlist" differentiator or the personalization angle. The copy communicates clearly.

## Strongest Lines (by frequency across all buckets)

1. **"Three filters. Five recommendations. Zero rabbit holes."** — overwhelmed_planner, quiet_explorer, budget_conscious
2. **"Stop scrolling six apps just to figure out what to do this weekend."** — overwhelmed_planner, routine_breaker
3. **"Exhibitions ending this week, sample sales, limited-run shows, neighborhood pop-ups."** — culture_seeker
4. **"No social media profile required. No influencer algorithm."** — quiet_explorer
5. **"We filter for quality so 'free' doesn't mean 'not actually fun.'"** — budget_conscious_socializer
6. **"Your weekend shouldn't take longer to plan than to enjoy."** — cross-bucket

---

## Most Common Objections

1. **"Product doesn't exist yet"** — can't judge from a landing page (cross-bucket, but especially planners)
2. **"No group/social features"** — routine_breaker and overwhelmed_planner want group planning
3. **"How does the algorithm work?"** — quiet_explorer wants transparency, not trust-me claims
4. **"Catalog depth is unproven"** — culture_seeker needs more than one example card
5. **"Is the app free?"** — budget_conscious_socializer needs explicit confirmation
6. **"Waitlist feels passive"** — multiple buckets want a launch date or something more active

## Weakest Sections (by bucket)

| Bucket | Weakest Section | Why |
|--------|----------------|-----|
| overwhelmed_planner | Social proof | Quotes describe the problem, not the solution. No actual users. |
| routine_breaker | Hero | "Scrolling six apps" framing doesn't match their behavior (they text friends, not research) |
| quiet_explorer | Social proof + Objection handling | Interview quotes feel like marketing. "Gets sharper" is unsubstantiated. |
| culture_seeker | How It Works | One example card isn't enough. Need to see variety and catalog depth. |
| budget_conscious_socializer | How It Works + Social proof | Budget filter is mentioned once. No social proof quotes about cost. |

---

## Freemium Expectations

| Expectation | Count | Pct |
|-------------|-------|-----|
| Expect free | 16 | 26.7% |
| Freemium | 29 | 48.3% |
| Would pay | 15 | 25.0% |

Nearly half expect a freemium model. A quarter would pay if it works well. Budget-conscious socializers skew heavily toward "expect free." Culture seekers and quiet explorers are the most likely to pay.

---

## Share Triggers (top themes)

1. **"If the first recommendations were actually good"** — proof beats promises
2. **"If I could share a shortlist with my group chat"** — social sharing as core utility
3. **"If it helped me find something I wouldn't have found otherwise"** — genuine discovery value
4. **"If it made me look like the person who knows cool stuff"** — status utility (routine_breaker, culture_seeker)
5. **Quiet explorers: "I might keep it to myself"** — consistent with protective behavior from interviews

---

## Recommendations for V2

### High priority (biggest conversion impact):

1. **Add 2-3 more example cards** to the How It Works section. Show variety: a pop-up, a free outdoor event, a comedy show. This directly addresses culture_seeker skepticism and proves catalog depth.

2. **Make the budget filter a first-class feature**, not a sub-step. Consider a dedicated callout or mini-section: "Whether your budget is $0 or no limit" with a specific free example card. This makes budget_conscious_socializers feel seen.

3. **Add one line of algorithmic transparency** to the "How do you know what I'll actually like?" objection. Something like: "Based on what you pick, save, and skip — not your social media data." This addresses quiet_explorer's black-box concern without overexplaining.

### Medium priority:

4. **Add a group planning mention.** Even a single line: "Planning for friends? Share your shortlist via text." This addresses the #2 objection.

5. **Reframe the hero for routine_breakers.** The current hero targets research fatigue. Consider testing a secondary headline that targets novelty: "Your next favorite thing in NYC — found in 30 seconds."

6. **Replace or supplement social proof quotes.** Current quotes are interview-sourced (they describe the problem, not the product). As the product develops, one beta tester quote would dramatically increase trust.

### Lower priority (V3+):

7. **Add a launch timeline** to the CTA. "Early access opens soon" is vague. Even "Spring 2026" is better.

8. **Test CTA copy.** "Get your first shortlist" may convert better than "Join the waitlist" — it's more concrete and implies immediate value.

9. **Address quiet_explorer privacy concerns.** A single line: "No account required. No data sold. No social profile linked." could reduce their 50% dealbreaker rate.

## Assessment

V1 is a strong first draft. The copy clearly communicates the product, resonates emotionally with 70% of the audience, and converts 57% on a waitlist CTA — well above the baseline. The strongest segments (overwhelmed_planner, culture_seeker) validate that the interview-sourced messaging works.

The biggest risks are the quiet_explorer segment (50% dealbreakers, needs transparency) and the routine_breaker segment (copy frames a problem they don't fully feel). Both are addressable with targeted copy changes in V2.
