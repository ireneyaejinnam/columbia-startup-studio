V2 Landing Page Copy
Purpose: Second iteration for synthetic user testing. Changes from V1: added 2 example cards for variety/catalog proof, reframed personalization language for trust. Last updated: Feb 24, 2026

SECTION 1: HERO
Headline
Stop scrolling six apps just to figure out what to do this weekend.
Subheadline
You don't need more options. You need the right 3–5, matched to what you actually care about — before they're gone.
Supporting line
Tell us what you're into, when you're free, and how far you'll go. We'll tell you what's worth your time.

SECTION 2: HOW IT WORKS
Section headline
Three filters. Five recommendations. Zero rabbit holes.
Step 1: Tell us what you're into
Pick from categories like live music, art exhibitions, pop-ups, outdoor activities, fitness classes, comedy, food events, nightlife — or go broad and let us surprise you.
Step 2: Set your constraints
When are you free? How far will you travel? What's your budget — free only, under $20, or no limit? We filter so you don't have to.
Step 3: Get your shortlist
We surface 3–5 things actually worth doing. Not a feed. Not 200 results. A shortlist — with the details you need to just go: what it is, where, when, how much, and why it matched you.
Example cards
🎨 Kehinde Wiley: New Portraits — Sean Kelly Gallery Free admission · Chelsea · Open through March 8 Matched because: you liked immersive art + you're free Saturday + it's 12 min from you Ends in 17 days
🌿 Spring Foraging Walk — Prospect Park Free · Prospect Heights · This Saturday, 10 AM Matched because: you picked outdoor activities + it's free + 8 min from you 6 spots left
😂 Late-Night Comedy Lottery — Eastville Comedy Club $10 · East Village · Friday & Saturday, 10:30 PM Matched because: you liked comedy + you're free Friday night + it's under your $20 budget Added this week

SECTION 3: SOCIAL PROOF
Section headline
Built from conversations with 50+ New Yorkers who were tired of the same weekend.
"We spend most of our time looking into activities that we end up not even going anymore. We just get overwhelmed and kind of give up." — Sam, 23, Advertising, Midtown East
"I didn't know this thing existed. I would do it as long as they tell me these things exist." — NYC resident, 20s, Upper East Side
"It's kind of a mess. I'm on Instagram, Pinterest, Google — I have no problem searching, but if there was a way to consolidate that, I would love it." — Pilates instructor, 20s, Brooklyn
By the numbers
87% of people we interviewed use 3+ platforms to find things to do
6 out of 10 said they've given up on plans because the search took too long
The #1 pain point across every interview: "too many options, not enough good ones"

SECTION 4: OBJECTION HANDLING
"There are already apps for this."
You're probably thinking of Eventbrite, Fever, or Time Out. They give you a wall of 300 events and let you figure it out. We give you 3–5, already filtered to what you care about. The point isn't more listings — it's less time deciding.
"How do you know what I'll actually like?"
You tell us. Not through a 40-question quiz — just pick a few categories, set your filters, and we'll build a shortlist customized to what you actually care about. Every recommendation shows you exactly why it was picked for you — so you'll always know it's tailored to your tastes, not just popular with everyone else. No social media profile required. No influencer algorithm.
"Will you actually have the niche stuff — the pop-ups, the one-night-only things?"
That's the whole point. The events you miss because they never show up in your Instagram feed until the last day? We track those. Exhibitions ending this week, sample sales, limited-run shows, neighborhood pop-ups. If it has a date and it's worth knowing about, it should be here.
"I don't want another app sending me notifications I ignore."
Neither do we. You set the cadence. A Thursday shortlist for your weekend. A Tuesday heads-up for things ending soon. Or nothing at all — just open it when you're ready. No engagement farming.
"What if the free events are bad? Free stuff in NYC is usually hit or miss."
You're right — it is. That's why we don't just list every free event. We filter for quality so "free" doesn't mean "not actually fun." You'll see what's genuinely worth showing up to, not just what costs $0.

SECTION 5: CTA
Section headline
Your weekend shouldn't take longer to plan than to enjoy.
Body
We're building the simplest way to find things worth doing in New York City. No feeds. No reviews to write. No scrolling through six platforms. Just tell us what you're into and we'll handle the rest.

NOTES FOR SYNTHETIC TESTING
What changed in V2
1. Added 2 example cards (foraging walk + comedy show) alongside the original art gallery card to demonstrate catalog variety — free outdoor event, casual/cheap nightlife, plus the existing art/culture card.
2. Rewrote the "How do you know what I'll actually like?" objection response: replaced "gets sharper the more you use it" with "customized to what you actually care about" + "every recommendation shows you exactly why it was picked for you." Framing is now warm personalization + visible reasoning, not vague algorithmic promise.
What to watch in V2
- Quiet explorer dealbreaker rate: does the transparency/personalization reframe move it from 50%?
- Culture seeker conversion: do the additional cards close the resonance-conversion gap?
- Routine breaker response to the comedy card: does a casual/novelty example make them feel more included?
- Budget-conscious socializer response to the free outdoor card: does seeing a demonstrated free event help?
- Overall: do the cards feel real or do they feel like marketing mockups?
