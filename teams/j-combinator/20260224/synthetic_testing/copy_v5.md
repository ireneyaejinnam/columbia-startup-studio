V5 Landing Page Copy
Purpose: Fifth iteration for synthetic user testing. Changes from V4: pricing language rewritten to explicitly state the app is free (no subscription); expanded example cards to better represent both low-key and social options (and added more free examples); added a concise sourcing/credibility line; replaced vague “coming soon” with “rolling out in small batches” to reduce waitlist frustration without committing to a date.

SECTION 1: HERO
Headline
Still going to the same three places every weekend?
Subheadline
Or scrolling six apps just to figure out what to do?
You don't need more options. You need the right 3–5, matched to what you actually care about — before they're gone.
Supporting line
Tell us what you're into, when you're free, and how far you'll go. We'll tell you what's worth your time — this week.
Credibility line
We scan dozens of NYC sources daily (venues, galleries, community calendars, newsletters) — then filter down to 3–5 picks for you.

SECTION 2: HOW IT WORKS
Section headline
Three filters. Five recommendations. Zero rabbit holes.
Step 1: Tell us what you're into
Pick from categories like live music, art exhibitions, pop-ups, outdoor activities, fitness classes, comedy, food events, nightlife — or go broad and let us surprise you.
Step 2: Set your constraints
When are you free? How far will you travel? What's your budget — free only, under $20, or no limit? We filter so you don't have to.
Step 3: Get your shortlist
We surface 3–5 things actually worth doing. Not a feed. Not 200 results. A shortlist — with the details you need to just go: what it is, where, when, how much, and why it matched you.

SECTION 3: SOCIAL PROOF
Section headline
Built from conversations with 50+ New Yorkers who were tired of the same weekend.
"We spend most of our time looking into activities that we end up not even going anymore. We just get overwhelmed and kind of give up." — Sam, 23, Advertising, Midtown East
"I didn't know this thing existed. I would do it as long as they tell me these things exist." — NYC resident, 20s, Upper East Side
"It's kind of a mess. I'm on Instagram, Pinterest, Google — I have no problem searching, but if there was a way to consolidate that, I would love it." — Pilates instructor, 20s, Brooklyn
By the numbers
87% of people we interviewed use 3+ platforms to find things to do
6 out of 10 said they've given up on plans because the search took too long
The #1 pain point across every interview: "too many options, not enough good ones"

SECTION 4: OBJECTION HANDLING
"There are already apps for this."
You're probably thinking of Eventbrite, Fever, or Time Out. They give you a wall of 300 events and let you figure it out. We give you 3–5, already filtered to what you care about. The point isn't more listings — it's less time deciding.
"How do you know what I'll actually like?"
You tell us. Not through a 40-question quiz — just pick a few categories, set your filters, and we'll build a shortlist customized to what you actually care about. Every recommendation shows you exactly why it was picked for you — so you'll always know it's tailored to your tastes, not just popular with everyone else. No social media profile required. No influencer algorithm. We never use your social feed. Your preferences stay private. You can share an event without sharing your profile.
"Will you actually have the niche stuff — the pop-ups, the one-night-only things?"
That's the whole point. The events you miss because they never show up in your Instagram feed until the last day? We track those. Exhibitions ending this week, sample sales, limited-run shows, neighborhood pop-ups. If it has a date and it's worth knowing about, it should be here.
"Is this free?"
The app is free. No subscription. Events themselves may be free or paid — you choose your budget (free-only, under $20, or no limit), and we stay within it.
