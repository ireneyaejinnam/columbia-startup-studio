## Hero

**Label:** NYC Event Discovery

**Headline:**
Stop scrolling six apps just to figure out what to do this weekend.

**Subheadline:**
You don't need more options. You need the right 3–5, matched to what you actually care about — before they're gone.

**Supporting line:**
Tell us what you're into, when you're free, and how far you'll go. We'll tell you what's worth your time.

**CTA:** Show me what's happening →

## How It Works

**Headline:**
Three filters. Five recommendations. Zero rabbit holes.

**Step 1: Tell us what you're into**
Pick from live music, art exhibitions, pop-ups, outdoor activities, fitness classes, comedy, food events, nightlife — or go broad and let us surprise you.

**Step 2: Set your constraints**
When are you free? How far will you travel? What's your budget — free only, under $20, or no limit? We filter so you don't have to.

**Step 3: Get your shortlist**
We surface 3–5 things actually worth doing. Not a feed. Not 200 results. A shortlist — with the details you need to just go.

### Example Recommendation Cards

*Intro line:* Every recommendation shows you exactly why it was picked for you:

**Card 1 — Art**
Kehinde Wiley: New Portraits
Sean Kelly Gallery · Free · Chelsea
*Matched because: you liked immersive art + you're free Saturday + it's 12 min from you*
Ends in 17 days

**Card 2 — Outdoors**
Spring Foraging Walk
Prospect Park · Free · Brooklyn
*Matched because: you picked outdoors + Saturday morning + it's in your neighborhood*
This Saturday

**Card 3 — Comedy**
Late-Night Comedy Lottery
Eastville Comedy Club · $10 · East Village
*Matched because: you liked comedy + you're free Friday + under your $20 budget*

## Social Proof

**Label:** From real New Yorkers

**Headline:**
Built from conversations with 50+ people who were tired of the same weekend.

**Quote 1:**
"We spend most of our time looking into activities that we end up not even going anymore. We just get overwhelmed and kind of give up."
— Sam, 23, Advertising, Midtown East

**Quote 2:**
"I didn't know this thing existed. I would do it as long as they tell me these things exist."
— NYC resident, 20s, Upper East Side

**Quote 3:**
"It's kind of a mess. I'm on Instagram, Pinterest, Google — if there was a way to consolidate that, I would love it."
— Pilates instructor, 20s, Brooklyn

### Stats

- **87%** use 3+ platforms to find things to do
- **6 in 10** gave up on plans because the search took too long
- **#1 pain point:** "too many options, not enough good ones"

## Objection Handling

**Label:** Common questions
**Headline:** You're probably wondering

**"There are already apps for this."**
You're probably thinking of Eventbrite, Fever, or Time Out. They give you a wall of 300 events and let you figure it out. Sift gives you 3–5, already filtered to what you care about. The point isn't more listings — it's less time deciding.

**"How do you know what I'll actually like?"**
You tell us. Pick a few categories, set your filters, and every recommendation shows you exactly why it was picked — based on what you choose, save, and skip. Not your social media data. Not an influencer algorithm. Just your preferences.

**"Will you have the niche stuff — pop-ups, one-night-only things?"**
That's the whole point. The events you miss because they never show up in your Instagram feed until the last day? We track those. Exhibitions ending this week, sample sales, limited-run shows, neighborhood pop-ups. If it has a date and it's worth knowing about, it should be here.

**"I don't want another app sending me notifications I ignore."**
Neither do we. You set the cadence. A Thursday shortlist for your weekend. A Tuesday heads-up for things ending soon. Or nothing at all — just open it when you're ready. No engagement farming.

**"What if the free events are bad?"**
You're right — free stuff in NYC is hit or miss. That's why we don't just list every free event. We filter for quality so "free" doesn't mean "not actually fun." You'll see what's genuinely worth showing up to, not just what costs $0.

**"Is Sift free?"**
Yes. Sift is free to use. We'll never charge you to find things to do.

**"What about my privacy?"**
No account required to browse. No social media profile linked. No data sold. Your preferences stay yours.

## Copy Decisions (from synthetic testing)

Changes incorporated from V1 → V2 testing:

1. **Added two example cards** (foraging walk, comedy lottery) alongside the original Wiley card. V1 testing showed culture seekers needed proof of catalog depth — one card wasn't enough. V2 result: culture seeker conversion jumped from 58% → 75%.

2. **Replaced "gets sharper the more you use it"** with visible match reasoning on cards ("Matched because…") and transparent personalization language ("based on what you choose, save, and skip — not your social media data"). V1 testing showed quiet explorers had 50% dealbreaker rate driven by black-box skepticism. V2 result: dealbreakers dropped from 50% → 25%.

3. **Added "Is Sift free?" and privacy objection handlers.** V2 testing flagged these as active dealbreakers for budget-conscious socializers and quiet explorers respectively.

4. **Made budget filter more prominent** in Step 2 ("free only, under $20, or no limit" is bolded). V1 testing showed budget-conscious socializers felt invisible in the copy.

5. **Added "Spring 2026" launch timeline** to CTA subtext. V1 and V2 both flagged "early access opens soon" as too vague.
