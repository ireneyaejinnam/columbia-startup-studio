| **Problem confirmed?** | Y |
| **Key quote** | The single most revealing thing they said — use their exact words |
| **Emotional intensity** | “In a perfect world it would be nice to have an app that does everything.” |
| **Current solution** | Uses multiple platforms: Instagram ads, Google, Eventbrite, Dice, Resident Advisor, Partiful, Google Maps pins, TikTok/Reels, texting friends |
| **Money spent?** | Painting classes (multi-week, expensive), book club offshoots ($25), general NYC activity spending? |
