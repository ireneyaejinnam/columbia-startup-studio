## Who Did You Talk To?

## What Did You Learn?
| | |
|---|---|
| **Problem confirmed?** | Yes — described wanting more organic ways to meet people and discovering events too late |
| **Key quote** | "Sometimes you don't even realize there's some fun event going on until it passed… sometimes these events are one time events. They're not recurring. So it's not like you can go after seeing a review." |
| **Emotional intensity** | 5 — thoughtful and engaged but not deeply frustrated; more "it would be nice" energy than "this is killing me" |
| **Current solution** | Friends' Instagram stories (save posts to try later), word of mouth, specific friends for specific categories (one for restaurants, one for concerts) |
| **Money spent?** | No |
| **Surprise** | She highlighted the *timing gap* for one-off events — reviews are useless if the event is already over by the time someone reviews it. This is a structural problem that a review-based product may not solve without also being an event discovery/calendar tool. |

## Solution Reaction
| | |
|---|---|
| **Their reaction** | Positive — "I think I would use it" — with practical ideas about what would make it work |
| **Key quote** | "If it was a simple star rating review or like if I liked it or not, I think I would just go in and just leave it. And then if it tells me that the more you input the more accurate the training will be, then I think maybe I would do it even more." |
| **Biggest concern** | Review friction — she's self-aware that she gets "lazy filling out exact forms." Needs it to be dead simple (thumbs up/down level). Also wants incentives like points, early access, or exclusive perks. |

## Commitments

|---|---|
| **Referral?** | Yes |
| **Follow-up?** | Not explicitly asked |
| **Pre-purchase?** | Not asked |

## Overall Signal
🟡 **YELLOW** — Mixed signal. She confirmed the problem and had constructive ideas (trending in your area, simple ratings, incentive systems), but her emotional intensity was moderate. Her strongest pain point — meeting people organically and discovering time-limited events — points toward event discovery more than social review. She'd use the app but isn't desperate for it.

## One-Sentence Takeaway
A review-based product has a fundamental timing problem for one-off events — by the time reviews exist, the event is gone — which means the product may need to function as a forward-looking discovery tool, not just a backward-looking rating platform.
