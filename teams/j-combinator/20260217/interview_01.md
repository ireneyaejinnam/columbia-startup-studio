Interview \#1 02/13/26

Hi Sunjana, I really appreciate you taking the time to chat with me today. I’m Jary, and my group and I are working on a Columbia-based startup project for class focused on improving how people discover things to do around NYC.

We’re still in the research phase, so your honest feedback will really help shape what we build next. And of course, everything you share will stay confidential.

**Interview**

Jary: **Tell me a little about yourself—what do you do, where do you live, and what does a typical weekend look like for you?**

Sunjana: Sure. Um, so I work in marketing at a media company and um, I've lived in New York City for like 6 years. I went to college here.  Um, so I feel like I've learned the city pretty well. Um, my weekends usually, like, for a while in the mornings, I had signed up for a painting class with my friend at the Brooklyn Museum, and then we would, like, get lunch or something afterwards, and then the rest of Saturday usually looks like exploring the city, um, hanging out at a coffee shop, or going to read a book or something if the weather's nice, we'll go to the park. And then Saturday night usually means, like, going out, whether that is just going to the movies, or a bar that we like, or if we get invited to an event, going out.  Sundays, then, reset day, like, working out, running any errands, and taking it easy, and Sunday night is usually more just like getting ready for the next week. So, yeah. It sounds like you do a lot, like, here you're, um, you're always, like, on to go doing stuff with your friends. 

**Jary:** Sounds like you’re enjoying the city a lot\!

**Sunjana:** Yeah, I do, um, I do like to do a lot. I think New York City is like the place to be if you're someone that likes to do a lot.  I have, like, a good amount of friends, um, and I love seeing all of them. I love spending time with all of them, so I just try to make time on the weekends because it doesn't drain me. I enjoy spending time with people. 

**Jary:** Yeah. And you said you went to college here, and...  Yes. Is there, like, a difference in, like, what activities you did in college when you were still in college versus, like, what you're doing now? Do you think it's calmed down a bit?

**Sunjana:** I, yeah, um, that's a good question. I think it's changed definitely, and I think that's just, like, mostly the fact that my schedule has changed, like, before everything used to be around, like, my deadlines or school projects or exams, and also like my class schedule. Um, so that meant like, Things were a bit more flexible.  And I think having a 9 to 5 job now means that I have a bit more structure of when I have work and when I have free time outside of work. So actually, I've kind of seen the opposite effect in that I think I'm just, like, specifically someone that needs structure so that I have the time to designate to other activities. So I think I'm doing more postgrad.  In terms of exploring hobbies. I think, like, in college, a lot of my flexibility in the sense that, like, this is class, and then everything outside of that, it was just like, like, you're working out at, like, noon and it's just like a bit more awkward, I think. Um, because you're not moving the way that the rest of the city is moving, it feels like. met that, like, my priorities are probably a bit more different.  Um, and I had, like, extracurriculars through school, and I think those took up most of my free time is those extracurriculars. And so, and when you're young in your 20s, just exploring the city, like, your priorities are just different. Like, I don't think I cared as much about, like, making sure that I was, like, reading or taking, like, a painting class and, like, exploring that hobby.  I was more, excuse me, just trying to, like, get the full college experience. I see. If that means, like, going out a time or just making sure, like, I'm going all in on, like, my extracurricular activities. 

**Jary:** Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. And do you do activities as well after work, or is it just mainly reserved for the weekends? 

**Sunjana:** No, I think they, like, try to do stuff after work also, like, it has nose. I'm part of a book club that meets like every other Tuesday and then on like Mondays and Wednesdays, I'm taking a French class. So I think what's been really interesting post-grad, I think it's like given me like, almost the brain space to think about like, what do I like to do that's not just worrying about school and getting a job and like, a hobby, like a thing that I discovered was like, I like to learn languages.  And so I've like, willingly decided to like get back into academia, you know what I mean? And so it took a different approach to like how I look at that kind of stuff. I think I try to keep, like, Mondays I work from home, um, and Fridays I work from home, and so I feel like I try to keep things balanced, like, certain days, I'll just go home, um, make dinner, take it easy.  And other times, I'm like, well, I know I have this. So then I'll like take it easy the day after, if that makes sense. Yeah. No, I think they, like, try to do stuff after work also, like, it has nose. I'm part of a book club that meets like every other Tuesday and then on like Mondays and Wednesdays, I'm taking a French class. So I think what's been really interesting post-grad, I think it's like given me like, almost the brain space to think about like, what do I like to do that's not just worrying about school and getting a job and like, a hobby, like a thing that I discovered was like, I like to learn languages.  And so I've like, willingly decided to like get back into academia, you know what I mean? And so it took a different approach to like how I look at that kind of stuff. I think I try to keep, like, Mondays I work from home, um, and Fridays I work from home, and so I feel like I try to keep things balanced, like, certain days, I'll just go home, um, make dinner, take it easy.  And other times, I'm like, well, I know I have this. So then I'll like take it easy the day after, if that makes sense. Yeah. 

**Jary: ​​**Yep, totally. Yeah. And, like, you said you'd go to book clubs, you do, like, art stuff.  Where do you find, like, these activities? Like how, how do you scope them out? And yeah, where do you find, like, what to do? 

**Sunjana:** Yeah, I think the really awesome thing about New York is, like, it's very easy to find, like, a hobby that you're interested in as opposed to. Some of my best friends live in Boston or Philadelphia, and I think they have a much harder time finding similar activities. Like, I think it just takes a bit more digging.  Um, for a book club, for example, I got like an Instagram ad for it, and it's a music related book club. I'm a big music fan, and so they were doing a book club for an album that I adore. And so I was like, okay, I'll check this out.  I ended up making some friends through it that I'm, like, still friends with, which is really great. And I just have kept up with them on Instagram. Now I know that they also promote on Partiful.  And so, like, I think the turnout has, like, skyrocketed because of that, because people are always just, like, looking about what to do on Partiful. It's kind of turned into Eventbright in that way. Um, I think back when I was in college, I would go on like Event Right and stuff and like look at events and like, if it means like going out at night, I look at like dice or resident advisor to see, like, what events are being thrown.  Um, and then things like more structured classes. I've just Googled, like, I live in Brooklyn, so, and I like the museum. It's very close to me.  And so I was like, I wonder if they do any art classes, and they did. So stuff like that, I think, like, I think the 1st step is always, like, okay, like, do I have the time for this? And then the money for it and like, what is it that I want to do?  But I think it's, like, if you're interested in something as a hobby, like, it's pretty straightforward finding it in the city. So, yeah. I totally agree. 

**Jary**: So, you mentioned having a few like different platforms to scope it out. Is that a pain point for you or is it not something you think about? 

**Sunjana:** Yeah, no, I think so. I think, like, I think I know mentally because I've just been doing it for so long, like, where to look for what?  Um, like, if it's more social, if it's more like academic, like, you know what I mean? Like, I think I, like, know where to go, whether it be like social media or Google, but I do think, like, Like, for example, like, if we're looking for a night out, like, why am I looking on resident advisor and dice and, like, also, like, texting my friends and partly? you know what I mean?  Like, I think it is, like, in a perfect world would be nice to have an app that does everything. And I remember there used to be an app that like, you could, like, people that were throwing part, like, very similar to particle, but I think it was like very party focused and like, you could just like get on the list and like, show up and like, they gave you all the information. And then they got shut down.  And, like, I remember one Halloween, me and my friends just used that up till, and we went to like 4 or 5 different places and it was like perfect. Like everything was like planned out for us. Um, so yes, the long winded answer to your question is yes, I do wish that existed. 

**Jary:** Um, do you and your friends, actively share recommendations with each other or is it, like, just, um, just something you keep to yourself whenever you find an activity you want to do? 

**Sunjana**: No, we definitely share, like, I think I like to do activities with my friends, so, like, painting, for example, like, I take, I was taking it with a friend. Um, if there's like a cafe, I really, really like, I will, like, recommend it to my friends or take them with me. Um, I know my friends will always be sending me like Instagram reels and TikToks about places to try because I think like a lot of content creators in the city are really good at dedicating videos and even like full accounts to like things to do in New York City.  And so I feel like they'll send me a lot of stuff. I'll send them stuff, and then I also love pinning stuff to Google Maps to try. So even if I'm like forgetting to do it in the upcoming week, like, I can always, like, I'm in the West Village, like, what is the closest, cutest bar, you know? 

**Jary**: So you like to share and, like, um, see what, like, they think about the place that you're kind of go to and, like, just get a consensus. 

**Sunjana:** Exactly. Yep. 

**Jary:** And if there's, like, a quick, easy way trait, the activities you've done, like, for example, like, rated from one to 10 or maybe, like, qualitative qualitatively with words. What do you like, do that, like, for every experience? Something like a journal or a diary for your experiences around a city. 

**Sunjana:** Yeah, I think so. Like, I mean, I'm not a big foodie, so I, like, tried getting to, like, belly, for example, and couldn't, but, like, I know a lot of people that, like, like doing that and are super into it. And, like, I do stuff like that for, like, letterboxed when I watch a movie.  So I think it's always fun to do, even if it's for your, like, group of friends. I think, it's so funny. I think I always see, like, two trains of thought that are, like, I want to share activities with my friends and put them on, but then I also, like, don't want this spot to blow up because of this kind of ruined experience.  So I think there's like a balance to be struck that is like, yes, I want to share my experience at this place, but I don't want it to become like viral because then it's gonna like change drastically what that experience like is like in the future. 

**Jary:** H​​ave you, like, journaled before about, like, experiences or not really? 

**Sunjana:** Yeah, yeah, definitely. I like to, yeah, I like to write about how things went and whether they were good or bad or what they taught me. 

**Jary:** If you had to pick one category of activity in New York City that you consistently feel unsure about, what would it be?  Like, you're always, like, on the edge of like, oh, should I go there or should I not go there? Like, you need more information and, yeah, like, you wish there was, like, Okay, that's it. 

**Sunjana:** That's a really good question. I think, I think activities that have more of a price tag attached to them, I think when it comes, like, I think a lot of things, like class paths, even is really good at, like, telling you, like, what the instructor is like and all this stuff and, like, you know what you're getting yourself into and, like, like, you're only paying $20 to, like, have a good or a bad time. Um, and like, if you're looking for nightlife, like maybe you hit a cover, but you can always leave.  I think when it comes to, like, longer programs that are just promoted, like, for example, the Brooklyn Museum class, like it's hard to find reviews for things like that. And I think, like, I think there's just, like, less documentation about people's experiences and those things are expensive and usually go on for, like, a couple weeks. And so I think that would be a good example. 

**Jary:** So it seems like there's not a lot of information about, like, the art space or, like, museum events?

**Sunjana:** ​​Yeah, I would say so. They're like long programs in general that you have to pay for. Okay.  Yeah, I think, like, being, I mean, everyone, I think to kind of circle back to your last question about, like, whether I journal, I think, like, everyone is, like, our age loves to document and explain, like, and share their perspective, like, like, that's the reason, like, substack is blowing up, like, everyone wants to, then, yeah, tell other people what they think about something. And so I think, like, there is so much information on Google Maps and Yelp and, like, even, like, you can see on Resonant Advisor, like, how many people are going to the event and, like, on class pass, you can look at reviews and, like, but then longer events, more academic or, like, arts focused, like, or a book club, like, I wouldn't know. So, yeah. 

**Jary:**  If you were to see  your friends going to these activities a lot, say, scroll down your feed and you're like, oh, she went here a lot, and she seems to enjoy it. Would that, like, influence you to go as well? 

**Sunjana**: A thousand percent. I think, like, then it requires way less research on my end to decide if I want to go to the thing or not, because I'm, like, so and so went. Like, let me try it also, or I can reach out to that person, be like, what was your experience? 

**Jary:** Okay, um, okay, just one last question. We, you kind of mentioned it with the art, um, art activities, but of everything we talked about, what do you think is like the biggest pain point in your social life in the city?

**Sunjana**:  I don't know if this is specific to me or maybe a lot of early 20s people feel this way.  I think, like, there are, like, so many options, and so sometimes, like, there are too many options, like, like, I think someone in my 20s, like, living in the city on social media, like, I think FOMO is very common amongst people in our generation. So, like, you want to do a little bit of everything. You have this drive because everyone around you in New York is doing a little bit of everything.  And so it's very easy to get burnt out and also overwhelmed by like the amount of options. Like, I think, like, sometimes there are like too many things I could be doing on a Saturday, you know? So, yeah. 

**Jary:** Like there's some sort of fatigue associated with it. Yeah, yeah. Okay. 

**Sunjana**: Also, this is, like, a little bit off topic, and I guess, like, I already gave one answer, but another thing is, like, everything costs a certain amount in New York, and I think that's, like, something we can't ignore is, like, things can get really, really expensive, even if it's just, like, like, the book club I go to is free, but, like, sometimes they have offshoots, and it's, like, $25, and I'm like, I don't want to spend $25 just to sit and talk about a book, you know? So, yeah. Yeah, yeah. 

**Jary:** Like, there's always... I feel like every time you step out, there's always, like, a cash register sound off the top of your head

**Sunjana**: Literally.

**Jary**: All right, um, those are all of my questions. Thank you so much again for answering them.
