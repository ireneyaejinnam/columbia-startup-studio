Interview \#6 02/15/26

I really appreciate you taking the time to chat with me today. I'm Yijie, and my group and I are working on a Columbia-based startup project for class. We're still in the research phase, so your honest feedback will really help.

**Interview**

**To start off, tell me a little about yourself, what do you do, where do you live, and what does a typical weekend look like for you?**

Hi no problem. Happy to chat. I’m Ruby, 24, turning 25 in a few days. I live in Manhattan, in New York City, and I work as a data analyst at a small tech startup. On weekends, I’ll usually grab coffee at a small café in the East Village, bring my laptop or a book, and just sit there for a couple hours. Sometimes I walk through Central Park with my camera. I like taking quiet street photos, nothing too posed.

**Happy early birthday\! Since you're turning 25 soon, you've probably seen a lot of the city. How often in a typical week do you actually go out and do something social—whether it's meeting friends for a drink, attending an event, or a group hangout?**

Thank you\! that’s sweet. Honestly? Not that often. In a typical week, maybe once. Twice if I’m being unusually social. I’m not the “three happy hours a week” type. After work I’m usually mentally tired. So most weekdays I just go home, cook something simple, maybe scroll, maybe read. I’ll usually meet a friend for dinner or drinks on Friday or Saturday. Sometimes we’ll try a new bar, or just go somewhere low-key. I don’t really go to big events unless someone invites me.

**That makes total sense\! When you do decide to head out on a Friday or Saturday to try a new bar or a low-key spot, how do you actually find it? Walk me through the last time you were the one to suggest a place. What was the process from the first idea to actually sitting down there?**

Oh the last time I suggested a place was two Fridays ago.  A friend texted “drinks?” around 4pm, and I immediately felt that tiny pressure of okay, I should pick something decent. First thing I did was open Google Maps. I usually start with location. I’ll type something vague like “wine bar” and then filter by stars. Like if it’s under 4.3 in New York… I’m skeptical. Then I scan photos. The real customer ones. I check the vibe, the price and so on. I picked a small wine bar in LES that looked cozy, not too influencery. And it was pretty good. We sat down and it felt warm and not chaotic. I relaxed and had a good time there.

**It sounds like you have a solid 'check' system. Since you mentioned avoiding 'influencery' spots, have you ever been really excited about a place you saw online, and then been disappointed when you actually got there? What went wrong?**

Oh yes. And it hurt a little. Last summer I saw this cocktail bar all over TikTok — dim lighting, “hidden gem in the West Village,” dramatic smoky drinks. It had like 4.6 stars on Google, tons of aesthetic photos. I sent it to two friends and was genuinely excited. When we got there… it was chaos. First, there was a 50-minute wait even though it didn’t look that packed in the photos. Then when we finally got in, the tables were so close together I could hear the entire breakup conversation happening next to us. The lighting that looked “moody” online was actually just… dark. I could barely read the menu. And the drinks? Pretty. Very pretty. But $21 and honestly just okay. 

**That is hilarious, it's exactly what the TikToks never show. If a close friend whose taste you really respect told you, 'Ruby, I went to this place last night and it was actually quiet and high-quality,' how much would that change your mind compared to a 4.6-star rating on Google or a viral video?**

Oh that changes everything. If it’s a close friend — especially one whose taste I genuinely trust — I’ll take that over a 4.6 Google rating any day.

**It seems like that personal trust is the real filter for you. When you do find one of those rare, cozy spots that isn't a 'content factory,' do you have any way of keeping track of it or sharing it with that same group of friends?**

Yeah, I actually do. I have a private Google Maps list called “actually good” — which sounds judgmental, but it’s just for me. Whenever I leave somewhere and think, I’d come back here without hesitation, I save it there. As for sharing, we have a small group chat. I don’t usually blast it everywhere. I’ll just drop a message like, “Okay this one is worth it." I don’t love over-exposing good spots. New York already eats quiet places alive. So I’m a little protective.

**I love the name of that list. It sounds like you're protective of these spots because you don't want them to lose their 'soul' to the crowds. If there was an app that allowed you to rate these places on a 1–10 scale just for your trusted circle, and in return, it learned your 'Actually Good' taste to predict whether a new spot would actually be too loud, too crowded, or just right for you. What would be your initial reaction to that?**

I’d be intrigued but skeptical. I'd worry if it actually understands context. A place perfect on Wednesday might be unbearable on Saturday.

**That is totally fair. To make you actually trust a 'predicted score' on a Saturday night, what kind of information would it need to show you? Would seeing that your specific 'Actually Good' circle of friends also liked it at that specific time make a difference?** 

Yeah if it just showed me a number like “8.7 predicted,” I wouldn’t trust it. But if I saw that two of my close friends went at peak time and still rated it high? That would matter a lot. Especially if I know they’re sensitive to noise like I am. Also, I’d want transparency. Like why are you predicting this score? Show me the reasoning.

**That is such a sharp point. We’re almost at the end here, but looking back at everything we’ve discussed. From the pressure of picking a spot to the 'content factory' disappointments, what would you say is the single biggest frustration or 'pain point' in your social life in NYC right now?**

I’ll say it’s the invisible effort.  
Not the going out itself, I usually enjoy that once I’m there. It’s the filtering, predicting, choosing something that won’t drain everyone. The mental load before the fun. New York has too many options.

**I really appreciate that. Is there anything else I didn't ask about that you think is important to how you plan or discover things to do in the city?**

Nope. 

**Awesome. if we end up building a version of this that solves that 'filtering' problem, would you be interested in testing it out or letting me follow up with you?**

Yes of course\! If it genuinely helps, I’d be curious to try it.

**Alright Thank you very much\!**
