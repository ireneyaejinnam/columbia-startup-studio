Interview \#3 02/14/26

I really appreciate you taking the time to chat with me today. I’m Jary, and my group and I are working on a Columbia-based startup project for class focused on improving how people discover things to do around NYC.

We’re still in the research phase, so your honest feedback will really help shape what we build next. And of course, everything you share will stay confidential.

**Interview**

**Tell me a little about yourself—what do you do, where do you live, and what does a typical weekend look like for you?**

Okay. So what do I do? I am the Pilates educator/instructor, and I also manage my Pilates studio. I live in Brooklyn, and what I do is my weekend. Oh. I mean, I work at my part time job, so, uh, and honestly just hang out with friends, go to a museum, I'll work out. It really just depends on the weekend. 

**How often, in a typical week, do you go out and do something social? whether it's an event, class, bar, hangout, or anything?** 

Oh, I would say probably at the moment, probably, like, 20\. I'll grab, like, maybe a matcha with a friend or... 

**Think about the last time you did something fun on a weekend or a weekend? Walk me through how that came together from the 1st idea to actually doing it.** 

Um... Honestly, usually it's just my friends and I realize we haven't seen each other in, like, a week. It's really not that long a time, but, you know, and so we'll just decide, like, hey, let's all do something on Saturday. Um, our go to is to go out dancing, as you can tell. Um, but we also do things like just going to hang out in the park and things like that. So it's really just, like, anybody in the group chatting, like, Hey, we haven't seen each other. Let's make a plans

**How do you guys decide on where to go or how do you find the right places?**

Uh, it depends usually sometimes somebody will suggest something that they ever can already do, and then you can all, like, do make it a group thing. Or it's stuff that we've talked about in conversation before, they fought they're following up on it and decided... 

**What types of activities or experiences do you wish you did more of, but don't, and what gets in the way?**

I would say... Trying different restaurants in different areas of the city. So, like, I'm right now on the, like, Brooklyn's or, like, lower Manhattan. I don't travel. After the morning. I don't really travel any early than that. So, like, I would say trying to do things to explore other parts.   
I**s there someone in your friend group who always seems to know the best things to do, and how do you get their recommendations?** 

Honestly, I'm not gonna lie. I think I'm the best person in my friend group that comes up with suggestions, but it's really just anybody that, like, works good in the way of, like, if anybody wants to do something, everybody will join. Like, it doesn't have to be, like, all or nothing wants to do. It's really just, like, trying. 

**Where do you get your recommendations? Like, how do you hear of it, and how do you know if it? How do you know it's good?**

Um, it'll either be word of mouth from people I work with or my friend or, like, we scrolling the internet, and I'm just, like, looking for things that I'm calling. already curious in. Um, and there's that one, too, I was like, my stretches. 

**Do you do, like, a lot of different websites and apps to scour and scour the web for, like, recommendations?**

I feel like it's kind of a mess. Like, I would say probably Instagram is the most, the most used for suggestions, just because I want it so much, but, like, I'm also, like, Pinterest girl. I have no problem, like, because I want to go out to, like, a good cocktail bar. I have no problem Googling, like, best possible cars in flat iron and seeing what pops up, kind of thing, so it's kind of a mess. 

**Do you feel like it could be improved and unified into one platform, or are you, like, completely happy with the way it is now?** 

Yeah, I would love that. Yeah, I think, like, apps, like, open table and stuff in terms of, like, restaurants is really good, because they kind of, like, use solidate and offer, like, a lot of information without me having to do, like, a lot of labor. Um, so if there was a way to do that in, like, the, just, like, social setting of things, that would be cool.

**Have you ever wished you could easily see a running list of what your friends have done and what they liked it?** 

Yeah I would be open to that. 

**Okay. And do you ever rate things you've done on belly, on Google, on Yelp, or anywhere else, especially as considering, like, you're the one with the recommendations?**

Um, no, I'm very bad at that, actually. Like, I'm good at saving things and showing my people masks for painting. Um, but in terms of, like, leaving reviews and stuff, no, I don't really do that. 

**Okay. Imagine an app that learns your taste in social activities based on what you grade it, or I guess based on what you've saved, and predicts how much you enjoy things you haven't tried, what would be your initial reaction?**

Um... I'd be cool with it. Yeah, like if I feel like it's suggesting things that make sense based on my history or my, um, saves, whatever it is. Yeah, I would be definitely.

**Of everything we've talked about, what feels like the biggest pain point in your social life in the city?** 

I feel like it's... It's, um, really just finding what to do. Um, because in a city that has a lot of options, there are a lot of options. So if there was, like, a way to put in, like, a couple of things and get, like, very specific feedback or suggestions, I think that would be kind of awesome. 

**Other than restaurants, is there a specific category of activities that you feel, like, very strongly about, and, like, want to see more information, or just want to explore more?**

Yeah, I feel like more activities that have blending of, like, social groups or things like that are like, bring a friend and we're gonna go, I don't know, do a painter, create beans or, I don't know. Any activity that is social, but it doesn't feel like you have to have a number of people with you. Maybe you have one person that's, like, a comfort person, but you're also there to be some people. And to, like, just have an experience with small something. 

**That's the end of the interview. Thank you so much.**
