## Who Did You Talk To?

| **How you found them** | Referral |
 |

## What Did You Learn?
| | |
|---|---|
| **Problem confirmed?** | Yes — described struggling to find activities beyond eating/drinking and the paralysis of picking (shows, bars) without reliable signals |
| **Key quote** | "My boyfriend and I will be like, what do we do this weekend? We don't want to go out to eat. We don't want to go to a show but we also don't want to sit on the couch and do nothing, right? What are we supposed to do?" |
| **Emotional intensity** | 6 — not dramatic but clearly felt; the "what are we supposed to do?" moment was genuine and relatable, not hypothetical |
| **Current solution** | Word of mouth from close friends (no Instagram), Google Maps scrolling and pinning, specific trusted friends for specific categories |
| **Money spent?** | Not explicitly, though she does workout classes through Classpass |
| **Surprise** | She's deeply skeptical of influencer culture and openly identifies as a "lurker" — she won't interact, post, or like things from people she doesn't know. This persona is a huge design challenge: she's a valuable user (thoughtful taste, would benefit from recommendations) but nearly invisible to any engagement-based system. Also: she differentiates friend recommendations by taste alignment, not closeness — "some friends who recommend stuff and you're like, oh, I don't know about that." |

## Solution Reaction
| | |
|---|---|
| **Their reaction** | Interested, especially around hobby-based recommendations (knitting, crafts → classes). Would use it if recommendations were accurate. |
| **Key quote** | "I knit and I like craft, so like if there was a recommendation for other things like classes or things that you could learn, that would be really cool." |
| **Biggest concern** | Cold start calibration — if early recommendations are bad (e.g., keeps suggesting run clubs she hates), she'd churn. Also worried about lurker problem: people like her won't generate the engagement data the system needs. |

## Commitments

|---|---|
| **Referral?** | No |
| **Follow-up?** | Not explicitly asked |
| **Pre-purchase?** | Not asked |

## Overall Signal
🟢 **GREEN** — Strong signal, but for a slightly different reason than others. Her pain isn't FOMO or social coordination — it's the quiet, recurring "what do we do?" paralysis for someone who doesn't use social media and has narrow taste. She's underserved by every current platform. If the product can nail personalized recommendations beyond food/nightlife (classes, crafts, niche hobbies), she's a loyal user. The cold start problem is her dealbreaker.

## One-Sentence Takeaway
The hardest users to acquire (lurkers who won't post, rate, or engage visibly) for a social platform may also be the users who need this product the most — and solving the cold start experience is the make-or-break moment for retaining them.
