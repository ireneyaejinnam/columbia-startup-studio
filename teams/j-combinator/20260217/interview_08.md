**Tell me a little bit about yourself. So what you do, where do you live, and what does a typical weekend look like for you?**

So I'm a software engineer at Netflix, and I live in New York. A typical weekend for me would be usually just hanging out with some friends. Trying out new events around the city or restaurants. Um, yeah. and just resting at home otherwise.

**How often in a typical week do you go out and do something social, whether it's an event or a class or a bar, hangout, anything?**

I think around maybe like three times a week?

**Think about the last time you did something fun on a weekend. So walk me through how that came together from like the first idea to actually doing it.**

This past weekend my friend had a birthday party, so she brought me as her plus one to the party. We were just looking for something to do that weekend. We first decided to go to this birthday party together and then we also decided to grab dinner right before that, so we looked at restaurants to go nearby. And then booked a reservation, went to the restaurant, and then killed some time at a cafe afterwards, and then went to a birthday party.

**What types of activities or experiences do you wish you did more of but don't? and what gets in the way of that.**

I kind of wish there were more ways to meet people more organically. It's kind of hard to meet new people in the city in a more natural, organic way. I also feel like it would be nice if there were more tailored small group events. That you could just casually go without real commitments to try out new hobbies or learn new things.

**Where do you typically hear about things to do? Like what apps, accounts, people or sources do you rely on?**

Like, friends, maybe. Yeah, I feel like I usually just, like, if I see it in someone's story and it looks fun, if it's like a new place that just opened, like I could save it and then try to go next time. Or just through friends, talking to them. Okay.

**Is there someone in your friend group who always seems to know the best things to do? How do you get their recommendation?**

There is someone who I would always go to for restaurant recs. And then like there's also someone who I would go for like, she really likes going to concerts and stuff. If I wanna go to a concert, I would ask her if there's a fun event going on. So... Yes.

**Have you ever wished you could easily see a running list of what your friends have done and whether they liked it or not? And then do you... Ever rate or review things you've done on Google or Yelp or Belli or anywhere else? And what motivates you to do that or not?**

Not really. Um... I feel like if there is some incentive, I would. Like if it was like an app and if it said like, oh, it'll like give me more points or like more like exclusive, I don't know, like I can like make reservations early if I have more points or sometimes there's monetary value they give out if you collect 1,000 points, you get something, then maybe. I think I would if it was like leaving a review was easy, I would do it more.

**Then if your friend that you normally go to for restaurant recs or, like, concert recs, if they leave reviews, would you be interested in looking at it?**

Yeah.

**What kinds of activities would you want to rate or track? Like what would feel too personal or too boring to log?**

Um, I don't know. Maybe if it's like, I don't think I would like want to rate every single thing that I do every week. But if it was like an organized list of specific things.

**Is there a specific category that you might be interested in seeing? Like what other people recommended \- other than restaurants.**

Like any general things that are going on. Like a show or something that they've watched recently or an art exhibition.

**Imagine an app that learns your taste in social activities based on what you've rated and what you liked. and then predicts how much you'd enjoy the things you haven't tried, what would be your initial reaction?**

Um, I think I would use it.

**What would you like to see most on that app?**

I feel like I get really lazy filling out the exact forms, but if it was a simple star rating review or like if I liked it or not, I think I would just like go in and just leave it. And then if it tells me that oh the more you like input the more accurate the training will be, then I think maybe I would do it. Even more. And then maybe you could also do something like trending in your area. Like what things people are leaving reviews for and then there's another section tailored to you.

**Would you rather discover activities through a friend's feed, a personalized recommendation, or some combination?**

I think a combination of both. I would kind of want to, like, maybe follow some of my friends or, like, follow some friends slash influencers or like people who are always leaving reviews well like, "I liked this, I didn't like that" restaurant reviews and stuff. I would actively follow them and see where they're going.

**Of everything we talked about, what feels like the biggest pain point in your social life in the city? You said meeting people organically?**

Yeah, and then maybe like, sometimes you don't even realize there's some fun event going on until it like passed. I guess this is kind of different, but even before people leave a review, somehow you can find out because sometimes these events are one time events. They're not recurring. So it's not like you can go after seeing a review or maybe it only lasts like a week or two.
