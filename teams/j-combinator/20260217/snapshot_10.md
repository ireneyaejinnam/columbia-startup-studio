## Who Did You Talk To?
| | |
|---|---|
| **Name / Description** | Works at a hedge fund (stock investing), lives on the Upper East Side; socially active (2-3x/week), actively wants to expand beyond her usual routine into arts/culture |
| **How you found them** | Referral |

## What Did You Learn?
| | |
|---|---|
| **Problem confirmed?** | Yes — described the problem with strong specificity and genuine desire; unprompted, she said "if you guys can figure out a way for me to do this, it would be really nice" |
| **Key quote** | "I'm in a passive position. If it pops up on my Instagram, it's not like I actively chose it. I want to be like, 'are there painting events this weekend?' … I would do it as long as they tell me these things exist. I didn't know this thing existed." |
| **Emotional intensity** | 8 — most energized interviewee on the *discovery* dimension; rattled off specific examples unprompted (candlelight concerts, sample sales, jazz bars, art pop-ups, the Van Gogh immersive experience); clearly excited, not just agreeable |
| **Current solution** | Almost entirely Instagram (influencer stories and sponsored posts); one friend who joins social clubs and invites her; Google for specific events (Super Bowl watch parties) |
| **Money spent?** | Not directly on discovery tools, but willing to buy tickets/admission — has purchased event tickets found through Instagram |
| **Surprise** | She's the least interested in friend-review features ("my friends would just tell me anyway") and the most interested in pure discovery of things she didn't know existed. Her framing of the app's value is fundamentally different: reviews are just fuel for the algorithm to learn her taste — the output she wants is *awareness of events she'd otherwise miss*, especially time-limited ones. |

## Solution Reaction
| | |
|---|---|
| **Their reaction** | Strongly positive — "that would be pretty cool" with genuine enthusiasm, especially around the idea of the algorithm surfacing things outside her normal patterns |
| **Key quote** | "I want to experience things I normally don't. So if they can make a recommendation based on things I normally do anyway, but kind of give me a recommendation on things I didn't know existed or kind of force me to try a new thing, that would be pretty cool." |
| **Biggest concern** | Not strongly stated — her main implicit concern is coverage (will the app actually have these niche pop-ups and exhibitions in its database?) |

## Commitments
| | |
|---|---|
| **Referral?** | No |
| **Follow-up?** | Not explicitly asked |
| **Pre-purchase?** | Not asked |

## Overall Signal
🟢 **GREEN** — Strong signal. She has a clear, specific, emotionally felt problem (missing time-limited cultural events), she's already spending money on the activities themselves, and she's willing to leave reviews if it improves her recommendations. Her use case points toward the product being an *event discovery engine* powered by taste-learning, not a social review app. Key design implication: the catalog of events matters as much as the recommendation algorithm.

---
## One-Sentence Takeaway
For some users, the core value isn't social proof or friend reviews — it's simply being *told that something exists* before it disappears, which means the product's event catalog and timeliness may matter more than its social features.
