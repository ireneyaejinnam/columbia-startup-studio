Interview \#4 02/14/26

I really appreciate you taking the time to chat with me today. I’m Jary, and my group and I are working on a Columbia-based startup project for class focused on improving how people discover things to do around NYC.

We’re still in the research phase, so your honest feedback will really help shape what we build next. And of course, everything you share will stay confidential.

**To start off, tell me a little about yourself, and what do you do where you live, and what does a typical weekend look like for you?** 

Um, okay, my name's Maddie. I work here, assistant studio manager. And I live in Brooklyn. I moved to New York in September after graduating from school in Boston. 

**Awesome. What does a weekend look like for you?** 

A weekend? Well, Saturdays, I'm here, so my weekend is actually Sunday Monday, but, um, lots of, like, resetting, grocery shopping, cleaning. I like to go out. Um, hang out with my friends. She's very... I think we're all going nice. I like to go thrifting. 

**Gotcha. Where do you find things to do around a city?** 

Um, like, honestly, word of mouth, like, through my friends. Sometimes I just walk around, it's, like, go into these places. Or like TikTok, Instagram. 

**Have you used, like, Google reviews to check the place out as well or not really?** 

A little bit, but honestly, I look at reviews on, like, social media more often than I look on Google reviews. Okay. But I use, like, for food, I use Beli.

**Gotcha. Have you had any trouble looking for things to do around a city? Do you feel like it could be improved?** 

Yeah, occasionally, I think that for me in New York is, like, there's so much to do. 

**Yeah. Okay. Um... When a close friend tells you about something they did and loved, how much does that influence you to try it?** 

A lot. A lot. Yeah. Okay. I trust my friend.

**Do you feel like you recommend things a lot to them, or is it just mostly done to you, or is it both ways?** 

I think it goes both ways. I think, like, different friends are the recommender for certain things. I have a friend that will be the person I go to for, like, food recommendations. So, like... Well, there is two other recommendations... activity... So there are specific friends for, like, specific or certain? Like, with their niches. 

**Gotcha. Have you ever wished you could easily see a running list of what your friends have done and whether they liked it?** 

Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That'd be cool.

**Do you ever rate things you've done? Like, I know you said you use Beli… What motivates you to do that or what doesn't?**

Yeah. Yeah. Um, for me, I can give it three things. Like, when it's participating in my friends, like, Beli, it's fun to, like, see what the table score was and stuff. Um... And then I also just like to, like, keep track of places that I've been. It's less about, like, the rating and what about, like, having somewhere that I can find, all the things and places I've been, so that I remember. So I can, like, tell people. Um... But I think I raise things... when I'm, like, super excited about them. We're super unhappy. Gotcha. If I'm in the middle, then probably not. 

**So when you feel strongly about, like, a specific place? And you said, do you like journal normally or no?** 

Sometimes**.** 

**Gotcha. And the next question is, what kind of activities would you want to rate or check? And what would feel too personal or too boring?** 

I like rating places I eat, movies I guess I wouldn't rate, like, a doctor's office. unless it was, like, really horrible. Uh, Totally. Um, and then too boring? I guess, like, grocery stores, but I also feel, like, passionate about grocery stores, so maybe I would write that. Okay. Grocery stores is interesting. 

**Yeah. Imagine an app that learns your taste in social activities based on what you rated and it predicts how much you enjoy things you haven't tried. So something like Beli, but not really. What would be your initial reaction?** 

I think that would be cool. I would definitely be, like, interested in an app like that. More of like social activities instead of restaurants. For social activities. Yeah. I think... I think that would be cool. Yeah. It would be interesting to see, I guess, like, cumulative opinions that are, like, formed into one rating, 'cause I also, it would avoid, it would save me time of going down, like, rabbit holes and review after review, after review. It feels all kind of, like, cumulated together. **Yeah.** 

**About, like, experience. 100%. Is there, like, a specific category that you want to see or do you want to see, like, a broad category?** 

**L**ike, activities, I don't know. Social event. It's hard to, like, think of a specific thing. Like, off the top of my head, but I would just say, like, activities to meet people and, like, do things in groups, I guess, 'cause I know, like, in New York, it could be hard to find stuff like that, so maybe get to have a minute. Okay, so, like, social activities, meeting people. Can you guys know? Not really parties or... I guess parties, but, like, not, I don't really know what that would, like, look like. 

**Yeah.** 

But... 'Cause obviously, a party's gonna be different every time, 'cause there's different people there. Um, so... I would say more, like... I guess, like, the activities, like, oh, like. Is there another path? This walking pack, or, like, this, like, bowling alley. I don't know. Okay. Only all it feels boring, actually, but, like, walking past are, like, some, I don't know. Yeah, stuff like that. 

**All right. Okay. Of everything we talked about, what feels like your biggest pain point in your social life in a city?**

Oh, okay. Um... I would say... like, feeling the need to spend money to socialize. Right, 100%. Because, like, in Maine, there's a lot more access to also to the outdoors. So, like, I can just go to the beach, meet my friends, or, like, do things like that. And in New York, like, a lot of the time, I feel like if I'm gonna do an act, like, if I want to hang out with someone, especially someone I'm not close enough to just, like, do nothing with. Yeah. You have to do something and have something funny. Yeah, which, like, is fine. unless I don't want to spend money. 

**Right. Since it's, like, kind of inevitable to spend money, do you think , seeing how much it could potentially cost would help?**

Yeah, I mean, it would be cool to, like, have a range. I would say.

**Do you think, like, whatever you search up stuff now, like, is there enough information about how much it's gonna cost or not really?** 

Okay. And, like, I feel like there's decent, like, cell phones. And also, like, I don't mind going with doing stuff, spending money. It's just, like, so many interesting to, like, have the ratings of free activities, especially, 'cause I think free activities are really hit or bad. Because, like, if you look up, like, concrete activities to do, there is a lot, but it's, like, it's not actually fun, or I'm not just gonna be, like... Yeah. Yeah. It's like at that point. I'll just go pay for something. 

**Yeah, like it's always a hit or miss.** 

Yeah, it's very hit or miss, yeah. 

**Gotcha. All right. That's the end of the interview. Thank you so much.**
