## What Did You Learn?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Problem confirmed?** | Y |
| **Key quote** | “We spend most of our time looking into other activities that we end up not even going anymore… we just get overwhelmed and kind of give up.” |
| **Emotional intensity** | 8/10 — Strong frustration around overwhelm, repetition, and wasted planning energy |
| **Current solution** | Social media algorithms, Beli (heavily), word of mouth, lifestyle websites, Instagram/TikTok posts, group chat research |
| **Money spent?** | Yes |
| **Surprise** | She explicitly feels “responsible” as the planning friend and wants reassurance before recommending something — strong social pressure angle. Also wants non-alcohol, daytime, and nature options. |

## Solution Reaction

| | |
|---|---|
| **Their reaction** | Very enthusiastic; immediately connected it to Beli’s model but for activities |
| **Key quote** | “I feel like if I’m able to do this with my activities… more people would find things beyond the normal routine.” |
| **Biggest concern** | It must feel centralized, social, and tailored — not another fragmented content feed. Needs community validation before committing friends. |

## One-Sentence Takeaway

For highly social post-grad planners, the biggest pain isn’t lack of options — it’s overwhelm, repetition, and the pressure of choosing something “worth it,” leading to decision fatigue and missed experiences.
