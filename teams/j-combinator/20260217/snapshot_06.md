## What Did You Learn?

| | |
|---|---|
| **Problem confirmed?** | Y |
| **Key quote** | It’s the invisible effort. Not the going out itself, I usually enjoy that once I’m there. It’s the filtering, predicting, choosing something that won’t drain everyone. The mental load before the fun. New York has too many options. |
| **Emotional intensity** | 7 |
| **Current solution** | Google Maps to filter by location and stars, scans photos to verify vibes, and maintains a private "actually good" list |
| **Money spent?** | N |
| **Surprise** | She is protective over good spots, suggesting that users may want to limit who sees their ratings to avoid ruining the vibe of a place. |

## Solution Reaction

| | |
|---|---|
| **Their reaction** | Intrigued but skeptical |
| **Key quote** | I’d be intrigued but skeptical. I'd worry if it actually understands context. A place perfect on Wednesday might be unbearable on Saturday. |

## Overall Signal

<!-- **Circle one:** -->

🟢 **GREEN** — Strong signal. They have this problem, it's painful, they're spending time/money on it. Move forward.

<!-- 🟡 **YELLOW** — Mixed signal. Problem exists but urgency is unclear, or they're politely positive. Need more data.

🔴 **RED** — Weak signal. Shrugs, no energy, never tried to solve it. Consider pivoting or narrowing your audience. -->

## One-Sentence Takeaway

The primary pain point is the "invisible effort" of filtering and predicting quality, and personal "gatekeeping" of good spots is a defensive mechanism against hype-driven crowds.
