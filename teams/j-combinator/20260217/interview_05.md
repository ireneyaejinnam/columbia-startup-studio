Interview \#5 02/14/26

I really appreciate you taking the time to chat with me today. I’m Jary, and my group and I are working on a Columbia-based startup project for class focused on improving how people discover things to do around NYC.

We’re still in the research phase, so your honest feedback will really help shape what we build next. And of course, everything you share will stay confidential.

---

**To start off, tell me a little about yourself, and what do you do where you live, and what does a typical weekend look like for you?** 

Um, so I'm, Sam, I'm 23 years old. I live in Midtown East, and here in the city. Um, I am two years postgrad, and I work in advertising, and I also work part time in Soul Cycle, and the whole weekend is probably me either grabbing drinks or dinner with some friends, maybe even going out. Um, but, yeah, we're always trying to look for something new to try, maybe a new place, or, like, a new bar. Anything looks, like, a good deal, or looks really fun, we'll try. But, yeah. 

**Where do you find things to do around a city?** 

Um, probably social media, whatever pops up, like, in our algorithms, we just send to each other. Um, like, me and my friends, um, or, like, new restaurants on Beli usually. Um, I'm a very active user, so the more I use it, the more, like, tailor it tailored it is to my taste, so I find a lot of new spots there. Um, and also just, like, word of mouth. Like, I have a lot of peers that are the same age, and, like, um, you know, have the same interests, so, like, whatever's recommended to me, I usually, like, check out them as well. 

**Okay. Have you ever had any trouble looking for things to do in the city and how do you, how did you get around it? And do you feel like it could be improved?** 

Um, yeah, for sure. It's definitely an overwhelming thing, especially if you don't really have any idea what you want to do, but just, you know, want to do something. I feel like that's a very common feeling in New York City. 

**Um, is that very overwhelming, um, if you don't have a certain, like, a specific idea in mind?** 

Um, and usually, like, websites, like, online, there's a lot of, like, New York based, um, like, I guess, like, culture and lifestyle websites that that I'll post, like, random, like, pop ups or activities. Um, like freestyle from New York, I think, is what it's cool. And, like, just, like, I feel like there's definitely, like, um, social media accounts that post about these things, but, um, I feel like I also hear about, um, pop ups and such, like, like, later. Um, than when it actually happens, I guess, I don't know, maybe that's just my algorithm.

**Would  want something that would, like, narrow things down?**

 A bit for me, 'cause I do get overwhelmed, like, the amount of options I have. Um, but yeah. 

**Do you feel like it's, like, pretty fragmented whenever you're looking for things to do, or is this, like, not really an issue for you? Like, there's, you mentioned, you go to a lot of different websites to look for something to do. You feel like there should be, like, a single platform for that?** 

Um, I feel like there's definitely opportunity there. Because, yeah, there's not really, like, a singular, like, platform that, um, you know, will have everything, like, all your answers and details for you. I kind of have to look for it, which, um, I'm, like, the planning trend, so I definitely have the energy to look into things more than my other friends, but it would definitely help out, um, where people, this was, like, a more centralized system.

**Right. What types of activities or experiences do you wish you did more of, but don't? And what gets in the way?** 

Um, I definitely would want to try things, like, outside of, like, the nightlife in New York City. Maybe just, like, um, you know, in daytime or, um, even maybe something, like, a little bit outside of New York, that's, like, like, a nature or something like that. I feel like I've definitely explored and made the most of the nightlife in New York City, especially being, so being, like, two years close to grad, that I think I wanna, like, slow things down. Um, and explore more options in, like, to make the most of my weekends. Um... Uh, wait, sorry. Remind me of the question. 

**What gets in the way of doing the things?** 

Um, yeah, I think I feel like I just, like, look at the same platforms as anyone would make it recommend the same thing. So it kind of gets repetitive. Um, especially, like, if you, like, go to the same places or do the same activities, um, so I want to be able to, like, find things more accessible and, like, more easily. Um, that's, like, outside of the nightlife in New York City. And just, like, more daytime activities, I feel like. 

**Is there any specific activity you have in mind?** 

Um, I feel like maybe day trips, I feel like there's a lot of, like, nature outside of New York City that, um, New York isn't really, like, make the most of, just because either they're not aware of how accessible it is, or... Um, I don't know, maybe, like, other things in the city get the way of them, um, you know, exploring that. Or even, just, like, more, like, less drinking activities. Um... I think, like, the technique can get, uh, in New York, you can get, like, ahead of yourself and my group. Um, you know, like, try to keep with the crowd and, like, go out and party a lot. Um, so you get overwhelmed with all of that content that, like, you know, really gets to, like, filter out, you know, activities that know involve, like, alcohol. 

**When a close friend tells you about something they didn't love, how much does that influence you to travel?** 

Definitely, um, influences me a lot. Like, I probably would want to try it. Um, you know, and, like, I wish there was also, like, a place I could, like, save these recommendations. Um, because, you know, everyone's just doing so much different things in New York, and kind of, like, lose track of it. Like, people people recommend. Um, but, yeah, I definitely, like I said, like, word to mouth definitely influences my activities on the weekend, because I obviously, like, want to do these activities with my friends. Um, and, yeah, I wanna make sure that we have a good time. So I like having that, like, assurance that whatever we're going to is worth it. people. Because I feel, like, responsible. Oh, yeah. 

**100%. Um, have you ever wished you could easily see a running list of what your friends have done and whether they liked it?** 

Oh, yeah, for sure. Um... Yeah, because one, like, it's just, like, nice to have that, like, as a memory, just, like, a record of, like, the things you've been to, there are, like, places you've been to with your friends. But also, um, I feel like it's easy to forget, like, your experience in a certain place, because, you know, life in York is so fast. Um, that, like, you know, you might forget a certain detail about a place that actually made it really special for you guys. So that would be really nice to, like, have, like, a place to, like, keep track of everything you do with your friends, if you like it or not. You know, I feel like that's also, like, a good way to, um, you know, see what your other friends are doing, too. But, yeah, I don't know. 

**Okay, and with that in mind of like journaling, do you ever rate or review tanks you've done on Google, Yelp, Belly, or anywhere else? And what motivates you to do that, or if not, if you don't?** 

I mostly do it on belly. I'm not really, like, a Yelp or Google reviewer. Um, mostly because I feel like there's, like, not really a social aspect for, like, yelp and Google. Um, Belly, I like how you can see, like, your friends, where they eat, what they thought about restaurants you like. And I also like how, um, the more you use, belly, the more tailored. It's, like, algorithm and recommendations are to your taste. Um... So I really like that about ballet. Um, I think they do a really good job of, like, encouraging people to try, like, new cuisines. like based on the things they rate. I know a lot, right? I know a lot of people, um, find it a little overwhelming to rate, like, their restaurants, but I feel like if I'm able to do this, like, with my activities or, like, things to do around New York, um, like more people, I think, would, you know, find things to do. Um, beyond, you know, like the normal routine that they have every weekend. I feel like that would be really helpful too, especially if there's, like, a social aspect to it. Um, you know, like, it builds, like, a community and, I don't know, just something to talk about with your friends. Like, with Belu, like, you can, um... When you see your friend again, and then you remember that they raided this restaurant that you've been wearing tray. You can always, like, bring your bed and be, like, Oh, I saw your post and belly, and you tried the treasure on. Um, you know, I think it's also, like, a good way to, like, um, keep towns or your friends without being too, like, you know, like, creepy. But, um, yeah. 

**Yeah, 100%. And I guess other than restaurants, what kinds of activities would you want to rate?** 

Um... Um, I think... Maybe even, like, concerts, or pop ups. Um... What else? I don't know, just, like, I know New York City always has, like, random events. Um, or, like, classes, like cooking classes, or, like, lottery. Just things like that, or even, like, a day trip. Like, hiking, or certain cranks or whatever. I would say, I would want to see what people would, like, think about activities like that, because, you know, it's, like, a big commitment, especially if you're the planning friend. for, like, a friend group to go. Um, you know, I would want to have, like, a reassurance on, like, you know, people in our community, people of the same, like, taste as us, you know, have good things to say about certain people, before, you know, recommending it to my other friends.

**Have you ever done anything similar to, like, logging an event or experience in New York City?** 

I would say, um, maybe just, like, hosting online, like, on Instagram or, um, maybe even TikTok, but nothing, like, specific about, like, breathing things. Just, like, being like, Oh, I had so much fun doing this, or, like, oh, um, you know, like, we went to this, whatever classic pottery class. But nothing specific to, like, rating or ranking and experience, just more, like, recording it, which I think is completely different, because, like, Instagram and TikTok, like, there's so much different content there. And, like, I know a lot of people do go to those platforms to look for, like, recommendations and stuff, but I feel like you have to do your own filtering for that type of stuff, and you have to be, like, careful where you take recommendations from as well. Um, so yeah, I think it's just a little bit more nuanced if, like, this was, like, more centralized, like, software. Like, so... Uh-huh. 

**And of everything we talked about, what feels like the biggest pain point in your social life, but it's like this covering places, vlogging them, rating them. What is your biggest pain point within this city?** 

Um, I think it's just maybe, like, things could can feel very repetitive really quickly. Um, like, my friends and I definitely frequented, like, a certain bar or whatever, and, like, now we're kind of just in that time, and I realize where we want to try something new. And we don't really, like, know which direction to go. So now we kind of, like, spend most of our time, like, looking into other activities that we end up not even going anymore. So we spend all that energy looking, and we just get well and kind of give up. Um, so yeah, I think like definitely like something that would help us with the process, like making it easier to find like new things that we would want to try. Definitely help us, like, you know, actually do things instead of spending all their time, like, researching and something like that. Yeah.

**Awesome. Um, do you have any other thoughts that you want to share about, like, social activities or?** 

Um, no. I think…

**All right. Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay. Maddie.**
