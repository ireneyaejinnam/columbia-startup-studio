**Tell me a little about yourself. What do you do? Where do you live? And what does a typical weekend look like for you?**

I work at a hedge fund investing in stocks, and I live on the Upper East Side. I kind of just hang out with friends and then try to find at least one or two activities to do in the city and then try to make sure I work out.

**How often in a typical week do you go out and do something social, whether it's an event, a class, a bar, a hangout, or literally anything?**

I'd say I try to keep it like three times, two to three times a week at least. Just because I feel like I need to force myself to get out, especially in this weather.

**Think about the last time you did something fun on a weekend. And then think about how you like planned it and everything. Walk me through how that came together from the first idea to actually like executing it.**

Last time, my friends and I went to a Super Bowl watch party. Usually, I don't like to go out on Sunday nights. But I'm like, it's a Patriots game I kind of had to go see it. And that was with a friend. And then basically, what we did was we just Googled it and was like, Watch parties in New York and then try to find places. And then a lot of these places need reservation or admission tickets just for Super Bowl watching. So we found one of them and we just showed up and it was pretty cool.

**What type of activities or experiences do you wish you did more of but don't? what gets in the way?**

I personally would love to be more involved in cultured stuff or art stuff. I mean, this is actually, if you guys can figure out a way for me to do this, it would be really nice. I don't definitely want to experience more of the artsy side of the city, whether it be like fashion or painting or, you know, any sort of like gallery, what gets in the way is more that I just don't even know how to, like obviously there are museums but more of those pop-up art events or art galleries openings, am I invited to those like is it just private or like, I don't even know where to even find them other than potentially thinking about joining some clubs but if there are ways I can just kind of look up what type of art event shows up each weekend and then if they are ticketed events, I’d love to do that, but I just don't even know how to really get like a good calendar of those type of things. When it's fashion stuff, like, I don't know where you even need to be in or if I can just be involved as somebody who just interested.

**Where do you typically hear about things to do? what apps, accounts, people or sources do you rely on?**

Basically solely Instagram. I get like these like, when I swipe through stories, it just pops up. That's how I know. Like you know something they have ads sponsored and then also I follow some like just influencers who do stuff in New York and then I kind of go to places. Like I'm going to this jazz bar with my family on Wednesday and looks super fun \- it's because one of the influencers posted it so I'm doing that on Wednesday night.

**Other than influencers or apps like is there someone in your friend group or like amongst your friends or co-workers who always seems to know the best things to do and how do you get their recommendations?**

Yeah. I have one friend. She just, like, proactively joins a lot of clubs. Like, social clubs. And then she would invite me to things. But that's, I think most of the time how she finds out about stuff at board events.

**Do you know how she, like, found those clubs or...?**

I probably am assuming it's Googling. Oh, okay. And she would just apply and go to the events. Probably just being oh like I know she's trying to get into this amateur women's golf club and then maybe meet people that way and then hopefully find friends and all that.

**Have you ever wished you could easily see like a running list of what friends have done and like whether they liked it or not?**

I'm probably less interested in that part. Just because if anything, I love to kind of explore new things. Not just things people already do or things I usually do. I’m in the city and I want to maybe just take advantage of what the city can offer and meet new people too. Usually my friends did something really fun. Like they'll probably tell me anyway. I wouldn't say I’d have to find out through a specific app. Or they post on Instagram. And then I can just ask them rather than having a separate thing.

**Do you ever rate or review things you've done or restaurants you've been to on Google or Yelp or Belly or anywhere else? And if you do or don't, what motivates you to do so?**

I actually do. And I usually, when I feel very strongly about something. Usually when I really, really like something. And I think the store or the restaurant can have a bad review because of, I don't know why, but I go there and be like that was one of the best food I've had. And then I read some reviews and they're trying to be like, oh, it took us so long to get seated. Or one of the waiters was really rude. And I don't know, maybe that part is important, but sometimes when I go to restaurants, I'm just trying to get good food. And sometimes the ratings are so low because of these things. But I get quite annoyed with that. So I respond, like I basically would probably do Google review, like five star, just be like, you know, if you ignore that part, the food is amazing and you should really try this. Eventually I'm going to a restaurant, and as long as I'm not going to like high end restaurant, I'm going for the food.

**If it weren't for food, what else would you potentially rate or keep track of?**

Personally, I love reviews for hotels and stuff, too. If it's a really good hotel I've stayed at, then I'd say, I mean, obviously, sometimes they're, like, maybe only three or four stars. And it's not the best ones. Obviously, a five-star hotel is going to be amazing and all that. So I wouldn't leave reviews for that. But more than anything, I'm like, wow, that was the best place I've stayed at for the money I paid for. Those things I'll probably usually leave reviews. Or if they have really special events, I'm like, oh, I never had this at other hotels. I'll leave reviews.

**Imagine an app that learns your taste in activities based on what you rated so far and then like predict how much you'd enjoy things you haven't tried like what's your initial reaction?**

I think I would like that. I like the aspect that it learns from your ratings than just say, I have to pick what I like to do. I mean, obviously, I'm sure initially you have to pick what kind of categories. But like, I guess my whole point of being New York, on my experience and personal life side, I want to experience things I normally don't. So if they can make a recommendation based on things I normally do anyway, but kind of give me a recommendation on things I didn't know existed or, like, kind of let me force me to try a new thing, like, that would be pretty cool.

**Then because you would know that, the algorithm will get better if it has more data of you, would that be one selling point for you to leave more reviews? Like, if the review system was simple enough?**

Okay. Yeah, I think I would. Or like sometimes, you know, the vote, those places, the reviews and they give like kind of buttons to like, like five bubbles to pick from. Be like, oh, very clean, thrilling, etc. Or like just like easy things to do. Like after, like I think maybe for Uber or something. I don't mind doing that. Especially I definitely would be more motivated to do it if that will give me better recommendations down the road for events.

**In terms of recommendation, would you rather discover these type of activities through a personalized recommendation through these algorithms or would you rather know it from a friend? So, for example, like, if you know a friend who, like, you think has good taste in art, like, would you rather learn that this activity is going on from them versus an algorithm or maybe some combination of both?**

Yeah, probably the combination of both. Just because, like, I guess if I had a friend who does cool things, I would have just asked them. I wouldn't have to stalk them through their events, right? Like, I would just ask them. But obviously it doesn't hurt to know what people recommend. But I guess if I use an app, it's usually for things that even my friends are not really thinking about doing that. I think it’d be pretty cool, I guess trying to like learn new experiences. And then if it's something I already do or my friends already do, like I wouldn't need an app or I would just ask them.

**Of everything we talked about, what feels like the biggest pain point in your social life in the city?**

I think for me, just like, I don't know enough. I want to do more of those like pop-up things. Or not pop-up things. You know, even like, the jazz bar I'm going on Wednesday, right? It's not the same thing every time, it's going to be different artists. Maybe they do it for like two weeks and a different art and then another artist for another two weeks. Just these even like rotating ones, if there's a pop-up or something, I would want to know and I will go, but I just wouldn't know where to even find them. I feel like New York City, like if anybody's doing any tour or anything that's like, or even artists, right? For like an art exhibition, if they're going to do a pop-up for like two months in New York, like I would want to know. But I just don't even know where to find them other than Instagram recommendations. And then once that shows up on your feed, it's already like one day remaining or something. And then it will only be like, it's not like I actively choose it either, right? Because if it pops up on my story or my Instagram, then it's like I'm in a passive position. versus an actively trying to be like oh i want to find this weekend are there painting events or like are there saunas i saw this thing so like i'm gonna go to a candlelight service on thursday i've never done that before and i was like that'd be super cool like you know i mean like just these and i was like i would do it as long as they tell me these things exist i didn't know this thing existed.

**But if you had to choose one or two or several categories that you would like to see show up with this app like with this idea, what would they be?**

I just like exhibitions in general. And pop-up events, oh, sample sales, that'd be nice. Yeah, like exhibitions. I like that. And I guess that's kind of a little bit pop-up-ish, right? Like if an art gallery has a specific person's art painting or whatever show for the whole two weeks or whatever, I'd love to know about that. So it's kind of like pop-up, but just exhibition in general. Even when, let's say I guess this isn't a pop-up exhibition, but you know how they have the Friends experience. I mean in New York, I guess it's permanent, but a lot of cities is not permanent. So it's like when they came to Boston, like I want to know if there's a Friends exhibition, I will go. That's not even art, but it's more like these exhibitions or like the Van Gogh art exhibitions and the immersive stuff. So it's like, yeah, just exhibitions overall. I’d love to know. I'm just thinking whether it be simple sale or pop-up things, like these are all things that don't stay there forever. So like, especially those I'd like to be notified, right? Like if it's a Met, like I would know the Met is always there or like the Fritz collection is always there. But like whether it be sample sale or that, it's like things that don't last forever. And I just don't want to find out like the two days before it ends, basically.

Yeah, and especially because you mentioned that like you wouldn't really care too much about friends’ reviews because you would hear them anyways. I guess like in that case, reviews won't matter anyways. It's more informational.

Yeah, or the reviews is more for, if I do it and then it learns more about me, then I will do reviews. Or the reviews make AI learns more about me, like, I will do reviews.
