*"Beli, but for Social Activities in NYC"*

 

Discovery Research — Problem Validation

Target: College Students & Young Professionals in NYC

Interview Duration: 30–45 minutes

Recommended Sample: 8–12 participants

 

# 

# **1\. Research Framework**

## **Problem Space**

Urban young adults (college students and young professionals, ages 20–30) in New York City struggle to discover and decide on social activities that are genuinely worth their time and money. Current discovery is fragmented across TikTok, Instagram, Google, group chats, and word of mouth. There is no trusted, personalized, taste-based system for finding things to do—only for finding places to eat.

## **Target Users**

•   	College students and young professionals living in or near NYC (ages 20–30)

•   	Socially active individuals who go out at least 1–2 times per week

•   	Heavy users of social media (Instagram, TikTok) and/or apps like Beli, Yelp, Google Maps

•   	People who experience FOMO and feel overwhelmed by the volume of options in NYC

## **Main Research Question**

| Primary Research Question *How do socially active young adults in NYC currently discover, evaluate, and decide on social activities—and where do existing tools and information sources fall short?* |
| :---- |

**Supporting Sub-Questions:**

1\. 	What does the current decision-making process look like end-to-end, from awareness to commitment?

2\. 	What role do friends and social trust play in activity decisions?

3\. 	Where do people feel the most friction, uncertainty, or regret?

4\. 	Is there latent demand for a taste-based social activity platform?

# **2\. Key Assumptions**

Before writing questions, we identified the core assumptions underlying the product concept. Each assumption is mapped to the interview questions designed to validate or invalidate it.

 

| \# | Assumption | Risk If Wrong |
| :---: | :---- | :---- |
| **A1** | Deciding what to do on weekends is a real, recurring pain point for our target users. | *No problem to solve; users are satisfied with their current approach.* |
| **A2** | Current tools (TikTok, Instagram, Google, Yelp) are inadequate for discovering social activities. | *Existing solutions are good enough; no room for a new product.* |
| **A3** | People trust friends’ opinions on activities more than influencers, algorithms, or review platforms. | *Social graph is not a compelling differentiator; users may prefer algorithmic discovery.* |
| **A4** | Users would be willing to rate and log social activities after doing them. | *The product has no data engine; recommendations cannot be generated without ratings.* |
| **A5** | Seeing what friends have done and rated would meaningfully influence a user’s activity choices. | *The social feed feature has no pull; users would not check it.* |
| **A6** | The concept of “predicted scores” for activities (like Beli) would be appealing and trusted. | *Users are skeptical of algorithmic recommendations for subjective experiences.* |
| **A7** | Activity discovery is social—people want to plan and do things with friends, not alone. | *Product over-indexes on social features when users want solo discovery.* |
| **A8** | The “activities” category is broad enough to sustain engagement but specific enough to be useful. | *Category is too vague (what counts?) or too niche (not enough content).* |

# **3\. Interview Guide**

**Part A: Warm-Up & Context (5 min)**

*Goal: Build rapport, confirm target user fit, and get the participant talking naturally about their social life.*

| \# | Question | What This Validates |
| :---: | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Tell me a little about yourself—what do you do, where do you live, and what does a typical weekend look like for you? | *Screens for target user fit; establishes baseline social behavior.* |
| 2 | When you think about your social life in NYC, what’s the best part? What’s the most frustrating part? | *Surfaces top-of-mind pain points around social planning (A1).* |
| 3 | How often in a typical week do you go out and do something social—whether it’s an event, a class, a bar, a hangout, anything? | *Establishes frequency and engagement level.* |

 

**Part B: Current Discovery & Decision-Making (10–12 min)**

*Goal: Understand the end-to-end journey from discovery to decision, without leading toward any solution.*

| \# | Question | What This Validates |
| :---: | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Think about the last time you did something fun on a weekend. Walk me through how that came together—from the first idea to actually doing it. | *Maps the real end-to-end discovery and decision process (A1, A2).* |
| 2 | Where do you typically hear about things to do? What apps, accounts, people, or sources do you rely on? | *Identifies current tools and channels; reveals fragmentation (A2).* |
| 3 | When you find something that looks interesting, how do you decide if it’s actually worth doing? What’s your “gut check”? | *Surfaces evaluation criteria and trust signals (A2, A3).* |
| 4 | Have you ever been really excited about something you saw online and then been disappointed when you actually did it? Tell me about that. | *Validates the hype-vs-reality gap (A1, A2).* |
| 5 | How often does the plan change or fall apart between “this looks cool” and actually going? What causes that? | *Identifies friction points in the commitment phase (A1).* |
| 6 | What types of activities or experiences do you wish you did more of but don’t? What gets in the way? | *Reveals unmet needs and latent demand (A1, A8).* |

 

**Part C: Social Influence & Trust (8–10 min)**

*Goal: Understand the role of social trust, friend influence, and word-of-mouth in activity decisions.*

| \# | Question | What This Validates |
| :---: | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | When a close friend tells you about something they did and loved, how much does that influence whether you’d try it? | *Tests strength of friend-based trust (A3, A5).* |
| 2 | What about an influencer or content creator you follow—how does their recommendation compare to a friend’s? | *Compares social trust vs. influencer trust (A3).* |
| 3 | Is there someone in your friend group who always seems to know the best things to do? How do you get their recommendations? | *Identifies “tastemaker” behavior and informal social graphs (A3, A5).* |
| 4 | Do you and your friends actively share recommendations with each other, or does it happen more passively? How? | *Reveals how social sharing currently works (A5, A7).* |
| 5 | Have you ever wished you could easily see a running list of what your friends have done and whether they liked it? | *Directly tests appetite for a friend activity feed (A5).* |

 

**Part D: Rating, Logging & Reflection (5–7 min)**

*Goal: Determine if users would actually rate and log activities, and what that behavior looks like.*

| \# | Question | What This Validates |
| :---: | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | After you do something fun (or not fun), do you do anything to remember it or share your experience? What does that look like? | *Tests natural logging/rating behavior (A4).* |
| 2 | Do you ever rate or review things you’ve done—on Google, Yelp, Beli, or anywhere else? What motivates you to do that (or not)? | *Identifies existing rating habits and barriers (A4).* |
| 3 | If there were a quick, easy way to rate activities you’ve done—like a 1–10 score with an optional note—would you use that? How often? | *Directly tests willingness to rate activities (A4).* |
| 4 | What kinds of activities would you want to rate or track? What would feel too personal or too boring to log? | *Defines the taxonomy boundaries (A8).* |

**Part E: Concept Reaction & Predicted Scores (5–7 min)**

*Goal: Present the concept lightly and gauge reaction. Do NOT oversell—let the participant react honestly.*

| \# | Question | What This Validates |
| :---: | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Imagine an app that learns your taste in social activities—based on what you’ve rated—and then predicts how much you’d enjoy things you haven’t tried. What’s your initial reaction? | *Tests appeal of predicted scores and taste-based discovery (A6).* |
| 2 | What would make you trust or distrust a predicted score like that? What would it need to get right? | *Surfaces trust requirements for algorithmic recommendations (A6).* |
| 3 | Would you rather discover activities through a friend’s feed, a personalized recommendation, or some combination? Why? | *Prioritizes social vs. algorithmic discovery (A3, A5, A6).* |
| 4 | What would make you open this kind of app on a Thursday night or Saturday morning? What would bring you back? | *Tests retention hooks and use-case timing (overall viability).* |
| 5 | What would make you not want to use something like this? What are the turn-offs or deal-breakers? | *Surfaces risks, objections, and competitive threats.* |

 

**Part F: Wrap-Up (2–3 min)**

*Goal: Synthesize key takeaways and leave the door open for follow-up.*

| \# | Question | What This Validates |
| :---: | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Of everything we talked about, what feels like the biggest pain point in your social life in the city? | *Final prioritization of the problem space.* |
| 2 | Is there anything I didn’t ask about that you think is important to how you plan or discover things to do? | *Catches blind spots in the research framework.* |
| 3 | If we built a version of this, would you be interested in testing it? Can I follow up with you? | *Recruits for future testing; signals genuine interest.* |

# **4\. Interviewer Cheat Sheet**

## **Do’s**

•   	Ask “Tell me more about that” and “Why?” as follow-ups—the best insights come from probing, not from the scripted questions.

•   	Let the participant lead. If they go on a tangent that reveals behavior, follow it.

•   	Ask about specific, recent experiences (“Think about last weekend...”) rather than hypotheticals.

•   	Take notes on emotions and body language, not just words. Frustration, excitement, and hesitation are data.

•   	Stay silent after asking a question. Give them 5–10 seconds to think before prompting.

## **Don’ts**

•   	Don’t describe the product concept until Part E. Let behavior data come first.

•   	Don’t ask leading questions (“Wouldn’t it be great if...”). Keep questions open and neutral.

•   	Don’t correct or debate the participant. If they say something surprising, explore it.

•   	Don’t try to cover every question. It’s better to go deep on 15 questions than shallow on 25\.

•   	Don’t take “yes” at face value. Always follow up: “What makes you say that?” or “Can you give me an example?”

## **Key Follow-Up Prompts**

•   	“You mentioned \[X\]—can you tell me more about that?”

•   	“What happened next?”

•   	“How did that make you feel?”

•   	“Why do you think that is?”

•   	“Can you walk me through a specific example?”
