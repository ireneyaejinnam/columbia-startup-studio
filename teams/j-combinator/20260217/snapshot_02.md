| **Key quote** | “It’s very easy to fall into the routine of doing new things.” |

| **Current solution** |Texts friends, organically organizes group outings, relies on social circle; no structured discovery tools |
| **Money spent?** | Yes |

## One-Sentence Takeaway

For highly social planners, the problem isn’t finding things - it’s escaping routine and discovering unexpected experiences they wouldn’t have searched for themselves.
