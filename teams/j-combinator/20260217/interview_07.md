Interview \#7 02/16/26

I really appreciate you taking the time to chat with me today. I'm Yijie, and my group and I are working on a Columbia-based startup project for class. We're still in the research phase, so your honest feedback will really help shape what we build next.

**Interview**

**Tell me a little about yourself—what do you do, where do you live, and what does a typical weekend look like for you?** 

I’m Tiffany, I’m a UX designer at a startup, and I live in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn. A typical weekend involves grabbing coffee nearby, maybe Pilates or the gym. If the weather’s nice, I’ll walk around Fort Greene or Williamsburg, or meet a friend for brunch.

**How often in a typical week do you actually head out for something social?** 

A lot of my social life is tied to workouts. I’d say 2–3 social activities a week. Things like Pilates with a friend, a midweek run club, or occasionally going bouldering together.

**How do you usually find these groups or spots? Walk me through how you discovered your current run club or studio.** 

Mostly Instagram, honestly. I found them through friends reposting stories, friends inviting, or just ClassPass. 

**Since you're using a mix of ClassPass for booking and Instagram for discovery, do you ever find it difficult to know if a new studio or activity is actually going to be 'your vibe' before you show up?**

Yes. All the time.  
Instagram basically just makes everything look aesthetic.   
ClassPass helps with logistics, but not vibe.

**When you're trying to figure out that vibe, do you ever look to see what specific friends are doing?**

Yeah, definitely.  
If I see someone I know post from a run club or a studio, that lowers the barrier a lot. Even if we’re not super close,  just knowing there’s a familiar face helps.

**I'm curious if you have a way of documenting these experiences for yourself. Do you ever 'log' or 'rate' the classes or spots you visit?**

Not formally. But if something is really good or really bad, I’ll remember.

**If there's a service that could let you see where your friends are up to or what studio or club are they joining, and whether they recommend it, how would you feel about using a tool like that?**

Hmm. I’d be curious.

**Out of everything we discussed, what is the single biggest frustration you face when trying to have a social life in New York?**

Everyone in New York is busy, ambitious, optimizing something. Coordinating schedules feels like solving a logistics problem every week. I think the hard part is choosing the right one.

**One last question, since you mentioned that coordinating and choosing the right activity is the hardest part, if we built a tool that effectively solved this and highlighted where your friends are, would you be interested in it?**

yeah sure I would be interested in it

**Alright Thank you very much\!**
