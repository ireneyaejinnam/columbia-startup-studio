**Tell me a little bit about yourself like what you do where do you live and what does a typical weekend look like for you.**

So I work in quantitative research at J.P. Morgan in New York City. I live on the Upper West Side. And my typical weekend looks like, on Saturday, I like sleeping in until like nine. Then I get up, I have a cup of coffee. I do the crossword or like the New York Times games. I read some news. Then I get up and then I go to the gym. And then after I go to the gym, sometimes I'll have plans in the afternoon for like hang out with friends like I don't know sometimes you go to workout class you'll either go to the gym or like do a workout class with a friend Or I'll hang out with my boyfriend, we'll do a walk through the park. Then for dinner, if I don't have dinner plans and I'm usually cooking, so I'll go to like Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, pick up stuff. Make food. And then Sunday, it's like kind of similar if I have brunch, then I'll go up to brunch. If not, then I'll just have I'll go get a bagel and a coffee And then. do laundry, catch up on what I wanted to do. I'm very boring. Yeah, that's basically my Sunday.

**Think about the last time you did something fun on a weekend. And walk me through how that came together. So from like the first idea to actually doing this.**

I went out for brunch. Well, I went home like two weekends ago and I was hanging out with some friends from home and we all live in different like not everyone lives at home we just all happen to be there for the weekend. So then we had a little coffee gossip session. From the beginning though, oh my god, that one took a long time to plan. Since we all don't live in the same place, that took like probably like a month and a half.

**And then how did you guys like choose the spot maybe?**

Oh, so someone came up with like, we have, I guess like you always have that one friend that like will be like, okay, here are the three options. Yeah. You know what I mean? Choose one of these. And then, like, everyone votes or whatever. So there's, like, a couple of cute brunch places, like, in the town that I grew up in. And there's a new one that one of my friends was like, oh, I just went to this place and it was really good. We should go back. So then we were all like, okay, that sounds good. So we went there.

**Where do you typically hear about things to do? Like what apps, accounts, people or sources do you rely on?**

I deleted Instagram so I no longer have that. But I think most of the time it's like word of mouth. From friends. Like people will say like, oh, I went here this weekend. It was really good. You should try it. And it's like mostly people that know you quite well. So like, oh, I thought you would enjoy it kind of thing. So I have, like, one friend who's really tapped into, like, the restaurant scene. And she's always like, oh, I went here this weekend. Like, I think you'd really enjoy it. Or, like, don't go here, I didn't like it. Also, I tend to scroll through Google Maps. I'll just be like, okay, I need to be in this area because this is convenient for the two people that I need to see. You know, equidistant from everybody. Let's pick this one. Then I'll just go on Google Maps and I'll just like kind of tap around and then if I hear about a good place, I'll usually pin it on my map. Like save it and then go later. And when you go back, you can be like, oh, I was interested in this place, we should just try here that's typically how I pick. I don't really rely on other things.

**Other than going out to restaurants or bars, what types of activities or experiences do you wish you did more but don't, and I guess like what gets in the way if you think about it?**

I think in New York, I struggle to find like activities that aren't like eating and drinking, like, or going to work, I guess like going to a workout class has kind of become my second thing. like secondary default it's like okay I don't want to go out to eat like we should just go do something. But in terms of what I don't do more of I don't know. I have gone to see a couple of shows, but I don't typically go see shows that often. I go like once every couple months. And the hindrance to that is just for me, it's hard to pick. I'm not a big theater person, but I do enjoy it when I go. Figuring out which ones to go see and which ones are like, I typically, and I also find that I don't necessarily like what everybody else likes.

You did mention a little bit that sometimes you like stuff that you're friends might not particularly like but when a close friend tells you about something they did and love, how much does that influence whether you would try it or not?

I think it depends on the friend, I don't know. For some people, I just know that we're more similar in terms of what we like. It doesn't mean that they're any less of a friend. But some friends who recommend stuff and you're like, oh, I don't know about that.

**It's just like you guys have different tastes, right?**

Different tastes, exactly. And, like, what they enjoy is not necessarily what I enjoy. So, like some people like really loud bars. There are some, like, super famous bars downtown that, you know, make amazing cocktails or whatever. I like going to them, but I find it's like really overwhelming and sometimes I'd rather just sit in a like more low-key bar and not get like something crazy you know yeah yeah but some people like super like that so like depends, right?

**Then what about recommendations from, the friends you trust or don't trust versus like an influencer or content creator?**

Oh. I think I trust my friends more because like, content creation to me sometimes feels like they're getting paid to say whatever they want. whatever the restaurant wants. And sometimes you see online, everyone will start going to this one restaurant and you're like, is that like natural or is that because they're being paid? I’ll be a bit skeptical like some people I feel like are truly genuine so you know, how I see it is, like, oh, I make that as, like, a mental note. Like, if an influencer goes to a place, I'm like, “oh, that looked really good.” And then I'll put it in a bookmark. And then, I'll wait until someone else has gone to try it.

**I guess after you like go to a restaurant or like watch a show or something, do you ever rate or review things you've done like on Google or Yelp or Belly if you use it or anywhere else?**

I don't use Beli, but, I think it's only if it's absolutely outstanding or absolutely horrendous. Like I don't review things that are in the middle. I think if it's absolutely amazing, incredible, I will rate it five stars or whatever. But I think I've only done that maybe like once or twice. And like the bad as well. Like unless I got food poisoning or someone actively was mean to me or did something to me \- I probably wouldn't try to tank their rating.

**What types of activities would you rate? Other than restaurants, if, for example, you had to rate something, for you it could be workout classes or shows or whatever. What would you be interested in rating slash seeing other people's ratings on?**

Oh, I find services, so like, who you get your hair done by, nails or things that you do, I don't know for me personally, I don't get my nails done every week, but some people do. So for me, I'm always, like, just trying a new place. In New York City, it changes a lot. Most landscape changes, like, even six months, like, it changes. So, like, I only go maybe, like, a couple times a year just like for different occasions so like for things like that it's helpful because I know that I'm not getting the feedback loop, like the really like every two weeks kind of thing. Yeah. So any personal service.

**Imagine an app that learns your taste in like any sort of activities based on what you've rated and then predicts how much you'd enjoy things you haven't done yet like what would be your initial reaction?**

I think in New York City, like, there's a lot of people who are like, there's so much out there, but you also don't know about some, it's like, you only know what you know. And it's also a function of your friends as well. So if you're not super big on social media, like me, or like, you're not, actively seeking stuff out, I do sometimes find that my boyfriend and I will be like, what do we do this weekend? We don't want to go out to eat. We don't want to, go to a show but we also don't want to sit on the couch and do nothing, right? what are we supposed to do? especially when it's cold out, like in the summer it's a lot easier because you can just like go to the park and vibe or like you know go sit outside to like have whatever and like you don't have to like eat a ton but you can like you know sit there and just like people watch. Like also, knowing you can, if you could input what you're generally interested in, like, hobbies and stuff. I don't know like I knit and I like craft so like if there was a recommendation for other things like classes or things that you could learn that would be really cool.

**Would you rather discover these activities through a friend's feed or a personalized recommendation or I guess, like a mix of both?**

Probably a mix of both. Because the thing is, sometimes your friends and you have super similar interests, which is why you're friends. Sometimes, I have friends where I'm like, I am not interested in your hobbies whatsoever. Not that I don't like you, but, I'm not interested in running a marathon.

**What would make you not want to use something like this type of app? Like, deal breakers or turn-offs?**

If the recommendation system in the beginning, you know how you have to give it time to calibrate and hone in on those things. So I feel like if you don't capture that in the beginning, it can be a turn off to some people. I feel like if it kept recommending me like, even though I clearly don't like run clubs, Running, then it would be kind of annoying. Or I think another thing is, Personally, I don't love the influencer culture, but the problem with that is that, if you have a lot of people like me who don't really interact with or post stuff. Like, I don't typically interact or like stuff unless it's like my... actually, I don't have Instagram anymore. But you know what I mean? If it’s a general persona that's someone who I don't know, I won't like things. So it's hard for you to have a genuine interaction with a friend who's like just a lurker. Like I'm a lurker.

**If you were incentivized in some type of way, for example, if we gamified something, if it gives you points and you could do something with those points, would you start leaving reviews?**

Yeah. Yeah, I think if I was incentivized to do it, I would do it. Like if we told you that, oh, this will **make your recommendation stronger, then maybe.**

**I don't think we will be able to track every single shows or museum exhibitions or workout classes \- I don't think we're gonna be able to capture everything, but if you have to, If you were to use the app, what category would you be interested in?**

Probably workout classes because like i feel like restaurants and that kind of stuff is super saturated. Workout classes and then maybe like shows or like concerts or the one-off kind of thing. But I think if you're looking for something more regular, I would probably pick workout class. More generic would be easier, but I guess there is more value in like one-off events because I feel like you don't know about it until you hear about it.
