Interview \#2 02/14/26

Hi, I really appreciate you taking the time to chat with me today. I’m Jary, and my group and I are working on a Columbia-based startup project for class focused on improving how people discover things to do around NYC.

We’re still in the research phase, so your honest feedback will really help shape what we build next. And of course, everything you share will stay confidential.

**Interview**

**Tell me a little about yourself—what do you do, where do you live, and what does a typical weekend look like for you?**

Um, I live in the East Village. I am paralegal, and also work at home cycle, and a typical weekend, usually, like, hanging out, going out front

**How often in a typical week do you go out and do something social—whether it’s an event, a class, a bar, a hangout, anything?**

Probably 4 times a week. Gotcha, gotcha. Four or five, so almost, like, every day.

**Think about the last time you did something fun on a weekend. Walk me through how that came together—from the first idea to actually doing it.**

Um, me and my friend were going to a show, and we just kind of started texting random people and got a big group together, and so all six of us kind of went to the show, and it was, like, a drinking game type

**What types of activities or experiences do you wish you did more of but don’t? What gets in the way?**

Um... I feel like more like outdoorsy things, but I think, like, just because it's winter, you can't really, like, explore, like, go to the park and do stuff like that. and also, like, expensive to, like, if you, like, want to go away and stuff. 

**Have you ever wished you could easily see a running list of what your friends have done and whether they liked it?**

I mean, I feel like I talked to my friends enough that if it's something fun, like I'll know that they did it. 

**Gotcha. And is there someone in your friend group who always seems to know the best things to do?** 

I feel like that's usually like me. 

**Do you ever rate, or do you think, or do you ever rate, or do you think you've done on Google, Yelp, Belly, or anything else?** 

No. 

**Okay, so imagine an app that learns your taste in social activities based on what are you graded? Or for your case, I guess you haven't grated anything. And Like, let's say you did. And it predicts how much you'd enjoy things you haven't tried. What's your initial reaction?**

Cool, yeah, that sounds like a good thing. If it exposes you to think that you wouldn't necessarily know you'd be interested in, that, like, an algorithm can detect for you. You know what I mean? But if it's something like, oh, like, I want to go mini golfing, for example, and I Google mini golfing, then I feel like it would defeat it, but if it could be, like, oh, you've done mini golfing, maybe, like, bowling, and like, that's something I had to consider. that would be really beneficial. 

**Would you rather discover activities to a friend's feed, a personal recommendation, or some combinations?** 

A combination.

**And out of everything we talked about, what feels like your biggest main point in your social life in a city?**

Um, I think I just, it's very easy to fall into the routine of doing new things. So I think by trying new things, seeing what's going on, like figuring out what events are going on in the city and kind of taking advantage of that would be cool.

**Is there a specific category of New York City events that you want to try more of?**

I feel like fashion would be cool.

**All right, awesome. Thank you so much\!**
