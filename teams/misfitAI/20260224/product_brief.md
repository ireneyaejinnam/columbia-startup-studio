## The Problem

Busy professionals and students wake up, stare at their closet, and waste time deciding what to wear that fits the day’s schedule, weather, and social context. [file:2]  
They juggle weather apps, Google Calendar, and a mental inventory of clothes, which often leads to last-minute stress, uncomfortable outfits, or defaulting to the same few items. [file:2]  
There is no effortless way to translate “what’s on my calendar + what’s the weather + what do I own” into a ready-to-wear outfit suggestion. [file:2]

**Who has this problem?**  
Urban professionals and students who rely heavily on Google Calendar and care about looking appropriate without spending energy on outfits. [file:2]

**How do they currently deal with it?**  
They scroll weather apps, skim Google Calendar in the morning, mentally filter their wardrobe, sometimes text friends or partners for advice, or repeat the same two or three “safe” outfits. [file:2]

**How painful is it?**  
People report decision fatigue in the morning, anxiety about being under- or over-dressed for key events, and frustration about owning “nothing to wear” despite having a full closet. [file:2]

## The Solution

We are building an effortless wardrobe planner that connects to Google Calendar and local weather to suggest what to wear for each day and event. [file:2]  
The app pulls the user’s schedule, checks the forecast and conditions, and uses a lightweight wardrobe profile (or optional item catalog) to propose complete outfits the user can accept, tweak, or skip with one tap. [file:2]

**What does it do?**  
For each day, it generates outfit recommendations tailored to event type (meeting, date, workout, travel), weather, and user style or constraints such as dress code, comfort preferences, and laundry status. [file:2]

**How does the user interact with it?**  

- Connect Google Calendar and location once. [file:2]  
- Set simple style and wardrobe preferences (for example, “business casual,” “no heels on commute,” “hate being cold”). [file:2]  
- Each night or morning, review a small set of suggested outfits for key events, then tap to accept, swap, or adjust. [file:2]

**What makes it different from how people solve this today?**  
It removes manual cross-checking of weather and calendar, avoids overwhelming closet cataloging, and delivers a “just tell me what to wear” experience tied directly to real events rather than generic style inspiration. [file:2]

## Target User

**Who specifically is this for?**

**Demographics**  
Ages 22–38, urban or suburban, students or knowledge workers, living in cities with variable weather such as New York City, Chicago, or London. [file:2]

**Defining behavior**  

- Uses Google Calendar daily to structure their time. [file:2]  
- Checks the weather most mornings. [file:2]  
- Cares about looking appropriate and put-together but does not enjoy spending 10–20 minutes deciding outfits. [file:2]

**How they describe the problem (examples to validate in interviews)**  

- “You never know what’s in your wardrobe.” [file:21]  
- “Sometimes I wear my cargos too much… I have a default that I will go back to.” [file:22]  
- “Sometimes I'm just wondering if the earrings will go with majority of my clothes.” (accessories matching the wardrobe) [file:14]

## Why Now

People’s lives are already organized around digital calendars, especially Google Calendar, but their wardrobe decisions are still manual and ad hoc. [file:2]  
Weather patterns are increasingly unpredictable, making daily outfit planning more complex and annoying. [file:2]  
AI-driven personalization and growing comfort with data-connected apps make users more open to automated suggestions that feel like a personal stylist in their pocket. [file:2]

## Key Interview Evidence

**Strongest quote**  
- “You never know what’s in your wardrobe.” – Nikhil, Columbia MSCS student, describing mental tracking and lack of visibility into his clothes. [file:21]

**Pattern (what came up across multiple interviews)**  

- Users often rely on a small set of default outfits (“I have a default that I will go back to,” “Sometimes I wear my cargos too much”) even when they own many more items. [file:21][file:22]  
- Wardrobe decisions are made quickly and mentally (often in 30 seconds) with no system other than memory, which leads to repetition and uncertainty rather than intentional use of the full closet. [file:22][file:21]  
- Several users care about whether items go with the rest of their wardrobe, such as accessories that match most clothes, but do not have an easy way to check that when shopping or planning outfits. [file:14][file:13]

**Surprise (what you didn’t expect to learn)**  

- Some users optimize for extreme simplicity through routines and identical items (e.g., owning 10 identical running shorts, relying on defaults) and resist AI styling because they see dressing as a creative, “fun” activity and worry an app would “feel robotic.” [file:22]  
- At least one user was more excited about analytics and engagement features (for creators) than basic wardrobe inventory, signaling a potential adjacent creator segment with different priorities. [file:18]

**Current spend/effort (what people already do or pay to solve this)**  

- Users spend significant time manually browsing websites (e.g., Zara, H&M, GAP) and trying multiple items in-store to find the right fit, often during limited windows like the first week of a semester. [file:21]  
- Some users avoid shopping alone and rely on friends’ reactions when buying items such as earrings, which can lead to purchases that later do not match their existing clothes. [file:14]  
- Influencer-type users can spend hundreds of dollars per month on clothes and content, and invest time in Pinterest, saved folders, and brand mood boards to plan outfits, although their primary pain is content burnout and engagement rather than pure daily dressing. [file:18][file:8]

## Open Questions

What assumptions still need testing?

1. Will users who currently rely on “default outfits” and 30-second decisions adopt automated suggestions if the system preserves a sense of control and creativity? [file:21][file:22]  
2. How light can onboarding be (e.g., minimal wardrobe profile vs. full catalog) while still delivering useful, trustworthy suggestions for both everyday users and more fashion-engaged segments? [file:14][file:13][file:21]  
3. Do users primarily value better daily outfit decisions, better shopping decisions (e.g., avoiding duplicates and mismatches), or both—and how should the product prioritize these use cases at launch? [file:4][file:14][file:21]  
4. For creator and influencer segments, is calendar + weather-based planning compelling, or would they require additional features like audience voting and performance analytics to see value? [file:18]  
5. What is the right pricing and value narrative for each segment (e.g., time saved, reduced shopping waste, higher content engagement), and which segment should MisFits AI prioritize first? [file:18][file:13][file:21]
