## Changes from V4

- **Section:** Audience only (no copy changes)
  **Change:** Replaced the original 5-bucket audience (Presenter Paul, Design Student Dana, Socialite Sophia, Resident Rachel, Vibe Coder Victor) with a new ICP-focused audience in `audience_v2.json`. New buckets: **Vibe Coder Victor**, **Resident Rachel**, **Recently Promoted Priya**, **Hybrid Office Owen**, **Light-Touch Styler Sam**. Dropped Paul, Dana, and Sophia. Copy in V5 is identical to V4 (`v4_copy.md`).
  **Why:** V4 confirmed that Victor and Rachel are the only segments with strong intent and low dealbreakers on the original audience. Dana and Sophia are fundamental product mismatches (style identity, not decision reduction); Paul has high resonance but 0% intent (sample output too casual). Refocusing the test on ICP-only isolates whether the same copy performs better when evaluated by personas who actually fit the product. No copy edits so we can attribute any metric shift to audience fit, not messaging.
