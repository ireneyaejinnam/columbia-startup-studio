# Wardrobe Planner — Landing Page Copy (V5)

V5 uses the same copy as V4; the only change is the audience (audience_v2.json — ICP: Victor, Rachel, Priya, Owen, Sam). Edit this file when you have V5-specific copy.

## SECTION 1: Hero

**Headline:**
One less decision every morning.

**Subheadline:**
Wardrobe Planner looks at your calendar, checks the weather, and suggests exactly what to wear — using what you already own, so you show up looking intentional.

**Primary CTA Button:**
Connect Your Google Calendar — Start Free

**Microcopy below button:**
No credit card required · $1.99/mo after your free start · Cancel anytime

**Why it's $1.99/mo:**
We're keeping it cheap while we're early — we'd rather earn trust than charge for potential.

***

## SECTION 2: Problem (Relatable Pain)

**Section Headline:**
You don't need more clothes. You need outfits that actually go together.

**Body Text:**
Your closet is full of pieces you like, but you never know what actually goes together.

So you default to the same "safe" outfit because you don't have time to think through what fits the day: the meeting, the weather, the vibe, and what's actually clean and in your closet.

And when something higher-stakes hits (a presentation, a date, a dinner, a travel day), you end up second-guessing: "Does this look intentional, or just… random?"

Wardrobe Planner turns your calendar + forecast + wardrobe into a small set of outfit options that make sense for your real day.

***

## SECTION 3: Solution

**Section Headline:**
Get dressed like it's already been decided.

**Body Text:**
Wardrobe Planner connects your Google Calendar and local weather to suggest complete, ready-to-wear outfits for your actual day.

Not a fashion editorial. Not a generic mood board. A clear outfit for a client meeting at 2pm and drinks at 7pm, matched to the 42° forecast and what you already own.

And if what you own doesn't really work together? We'll tell you — and show you the smallest changes that unlock the most new outfits.

***

## SECTION 4: What It Looks Like (Real Output)

**Section Headline:**
Here's what you get in the morning.

**Example:**
**Today:** 42° and raining · 10am meeting · 6pm dinner

**Option A (more polished):**
- Dark jeans + knit sweater + waterproof coat + clean sneakers
- **Why:** Meeting-appropriate + weather-proof + comfortable walking

**Option B (more relaxed):**
- Straight-leg pants + hoodie + light jacket + boots
- **Why:** Dinner vibe without looking like you rolled out of bed

**Quick actions:**
Accept · Swap one piece · Hide this option

The app learns from what you accept, swap, and ignore — so it gets sharper without you doing a big setup project.

## SECTION 5: How It Works

**Section Headline:**
Set up fast. Get better outfits all week.

***

**Step 1**
**Step Headline:** Connect your Google Calendar

**Body Text:**
Link your calendar once. Wardrobe Planner reads your upcoming events and timing so it knows what kind of day you're having before you even open your closet.

***

**Step 2**
**Step Headline:** Teach it your baseline (2 minutes)

**Body Text:**
You don't have to photograph your entire wardrobe.

Start with a few specific inputs:
- Your 2–3 go-to pieces
- What you avoid (colors, cuts, shoes you hate)
- Your default vibe (casual, smart-casual, business)
- Comfort constraints (layers, shoes, movement)

**Optional (for better results):** Do a quick closet scan with your phone camera so Wardrobe Planner can recognize what's actually there. Not perfect. Just enough to stop guessing.

***

**Step 3**
**Step Headline:** Pick one and move on

**Body Text:**
Each morning (or the night before), you get a small set of suggestions matched to your day. Tap to accept, swap one piece, or skip entirely.

You're always in control — we just remove the mental overhead.

***

## SECTION 6: Features / Why It Works

**Section Headline:**
Built around your closet, not a fantasy wardrobe.

- **Use more of what you already own** — You'll start pulling out items you forgot you had.
- **Weather-smart, wardrobe-aware** — Suggestions account for today's actual forecast, not just the season.
- **Event-matched** — A casual day and a higher-stakes meeting get different recommendations.
- **One clear outfit** — We don't flood you with options. We give you a confident pick.
- **Always adjustable** — Accept it, tweak it, or ignore it. It's a starting point, not a command.

## SECTION 7: Objection Handling ("You might be wondering...")

**Section Headline:**
You might be wondering...

***

**Q: Do I have to photograph my entire wardrobe to get started?**
A: No. You can start from just your go-to pieces + preferences. If you want better suggestions, you can do a quick closet scan later.

***

**Q: What if my wardrobe doesn't really work together?**
A: That's common. Wardrobe Planner will still give you the best options from what you have — and show you what's missing when the closet can't support the day you're trying to dress for. Over time, you'll see which 1–2 additions unlock the most new outfits.

***

**Q: What exactly do you read from my Google Calendar?**
A: Event titles and timing so we can match outfits to the type of day you're having. We don't need your invitees, notes, or attachments.

***

**Q: What if I want to make my own call on what to wear?**
A: You always do. Every suggestion is optional — accept it, swap one piece, or ignore it entirely. Wardrobe Planner is guidance, not a command.

***

**Q: Is this actually free?**
A: Yes to start. No credit card needed. If you decide to keep it after your free start, it's $1.99/mo. Cancel anytime before you pay.
