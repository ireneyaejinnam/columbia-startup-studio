## Top-Line Metrics (V4 → V5)

| Dimension | V4 | V5 | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Resonance | 23% | **32%** | +9pp |
| Intent | 12% | **20%** | +8pp |
| Conversion Confidence | 0% | **0%** | 0pp |
| Dealbreakers | 35% (21/60) | **7%** (4/60) | **-28pp** |
| Clarity nailed_it | 60/60 | **60/60** | 0 |

**Headline:** Testing the same copy against the ICP-only audience dramatically improved resonance and intent and collapsed dealbreakers. No copy change — the shift is entirely audience fit. We met the brief’s stopping criteria (intent ≥ 20%, Victor + Rachel dealbreakers ≤ 10%).

## Key Themes (V5)

- **“You don’t need more clothes. You need outfits that actually go together.”** and **“Does this look intentional, or just… random?”** continue to be the most cited lines; problem framing lands with the ICP.
- **Price:** $1.99 still widely seen as a good deal; “why it’s $1.99” still reads as startup-speak to some but does not drive dealbreakers.
- **Conversion confidence** remains 0%. Personas understand the offer and many would try it, but don’t yet believe the product will work for their real closet/context. Setup (“teach it your baseline in 2 minutes”) and closet-scan accuracy are the main doubts.

## Recommendations for V6

- Run V6 with the same copy as V5 to capture another round of qualitative signal and confirm metrics (or test light copy tweaks if desired).
- Longer term: improve conversion confidence — e.g. stronger “proof it works” (before/after, week-1 results) or clearer dress-code/context handling.
