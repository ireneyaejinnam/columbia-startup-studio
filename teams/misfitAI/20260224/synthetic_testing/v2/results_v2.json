That's a real miss. Also 'get dressed like it's already been decided' sounds like AI-generated inspirational copy.",
    "objections": "The core problem is that this still requires me to know my own wardrobe well enough to describe it. I don't. I don't know what 'goes together' \u2014 that's the whole point. A questionnaire about my 'vibe' and 'go-to pieces' is exactly the kind of thing I blank on. Also, no human stylist is involved? It's just an algorithm guessing based on my self-reported preferences? That doesn't give me much confidence it'll actually improve how I look.",
    "dealbreaker": "false",
    "dealbreaker_reason": null,
    "gut_reaction": "Concept is solid and the price is a non-issue, but the copy is written for someone who already has some fashion self-awareness. I don't. I need someone to tell me what to buy, not just remix what I already own badly.",
    "unanswered_questions": "What happens when my wardrobe is genuinely bad \u2014 not just disorganized but actually wrong? Does it tell me specifically what to buy and where? Who or what is generating these outfit suggestions \u2014 actual stylists, an AI model trained on what? And why are all the testimonials women?",
    "price_reaction": "$1.99/mo is essentially free, so price is not remotely the issue. If anything, it's so cheap it makes me question whether this is a real product or a side project that'll get abandoned in six months.",
