## SECTION 2: Problem (Relatable Pain)

**Section Headline:**
You don't need more clothes. You need one clear outfit.

**Body Text:**
Most mornings, you’re not confused — you’re avoiding the decision.

You default to the same “safe” outfit because you don’t have time to think through what fits the day: the meeting, the weather, the vibe, and what’s actually clean and in your closet.

And when something higher-stakes hits (a client lunch, a presentation, a dinner, a travel day), you end up second-guessing: “Does this look intentional, or just… random?”

Wardrobe Planner turns your calendar + forecast + wardrobe into a small set of outfit options that make sense for your real day.

***

## SECTION 3: Solution

**Section Headline:**
Get dressed like it’s already been decided.

**Body Text:**
Wardrobe Planner connects your Google Calendar and local weather to suggest complete, ready-to-wear outfits for your actual day.

Not a fashion editorial. Not a generic mood board. A clear outfit for a client meeting at 2pm and drinks at 7pm, matched to the 42° forecast and what you already own.

And if what you own doesn’t really work together? We’ll tell you — and show you the smallest changes that unlock the most new outfits.

## SECTION 4: How It Works

**Section Headline:**
Set up fast. Get better outfits all week.

***

**Step 1**
**Step Headline:** Connect your Google Calendar

**Body Text:**
Link your calendar once. Wardrobe Planner reads your upcoming events — meetings, gym sessions, dinners, travel days — and knows what kind of day you're having before you even open your closet.

**CTA Button:** Connect Google Calendar →

**Step 2**
**Step Headline:** Give us your basics (in under 2 minutes)

**Body Text:**
No photographing your entire wardrobe.

You answer a few specific questions like:
- What you wear most (your 2–3 go-to pieces)
- What you avoid (colors, cuts, shoes you hate)
- Your default vibe (casual, smart-casual, business)
- Comfort constraints (layers, shoes, movement)

That’s enough to start. The app gets sharper as you accept, tweak, or skip suggestions.

***

**Step 3**
**Step Headline:** Pick one and move on

**Body Text:**
Each morning (or the night before), you'll see a small set of outfit suggestions matched to your day's events and the weather forecast. Tap to accept, swap one piece, or skip entirely.

You’re always in control — we just remove the mental overhead.

***

## SECTION 5: Features / Why It Works

**Section Headline:**
Weather-smart. Event-matched. Built around your closet.

- **Use more of what you already own** — You'll start pulling out items you forgot you had.
- **Weather-smart, wardrobe-aware** — Every suggestion accounts for today's actual forecast, not just the season.
- **Event-matched** — A casual Friday and a noon client lunch get different recommendations.
- **One clear outfit that feels like you** — We don't flood you with options. We give you a confident pick.
- **Always adjustable** — Accept it, tweak it, or ignore it. It’s a starting point, not a command.

## SECTION 6: Credibility (What People Told Us)

**Section Headline:**
This is the moment we built it for.

**Pull Quotes:**
*"If my calendar and the weather could just spit out three outfit ideas every morning, I'd pay for that."*
— Priya K., Marketing Director

*"I don’t want 30 options. I want one outfit that works for my day."*
— Rachel, UX Designer

*"My closet is full of pieces I like, but I never know what actually goes together."*
— Tara, Account Executive

## SECTION 7: Objection Handling ("You might be wondering...")

**Section Headline:**
You might be wondering...

***

**Q: Do I have to photograph my entire wardrobe to get started?**
A: No. You start with a short setup (go-to pieces, vibe, comfort constraints). No hour-long cataloging project. You can add more detail later only if you want to.

***

**Q: What if my wardrobe doesn’t really work together?**
A: That’s common. Wardrobe Planner will still give you the best options from what you have — and show you what’s missing when the closet can’t support the day you’re trying to dress for. Over time, you’ll see which 1–2 additions unlock the most new outfits.

***

**Q: What if I want to make my own call on what to wear?**
A: You always do. Every suggestion is optional — accept it, swap one piece, or ignore it entirely. Wardrobe Planner is guidance, not a command.

***

**Q: Is this actually free?**
A: Yes to start. No credit card needed. If you decide to keep it after your free start, it’s $1.99/mo. Cancel anytime.
