## Changes from V1

- **Section:** Hero
  **Change:** Kept headline. Updated CTA from “Connect Your Google Calendar — It's Free” to “Connect Your Google Calendar — Start Free” and added microcopy with the real price: “No credit card required · $1.99/mo after your free start · Cancel anytime”.
  **Why:** V1 hid the price and “we’ll earn your subscription” language triggered suspicion across nearly all personas. Price perception was 59/60 “fair” but they never saw the number. Showing $1.99/mo reduces distrust and turns price into a reason to try.

- **Section:** Problem
  **Change:** Replaced “running late / staring at closet / same three outfits” framing with a broader frame: avoidance + defaulting to “safe” outfits + second-guessing for higher-stakes contexts.
  **Why:** V1’s “morning decision fatigue” frame was the #1 dealbreaker theme; it only fit Vibe Coder Victor. Presenter Paul, Dana, Sophia, and Rachel repeatedly said their real problem is credibility, wardrobe coherence, or not owning the right items — not “running late”.

- **Section:** Solution
  **Change:** Kept the concrete “2pm meeting / 7pm drinks / 42° forecast” specificity, and added an explicit line addressing the most common unanswered question: what happens if the wardrobe is the problem.
  **Why:** The 42° specificity line was a top strongest-line (22 mentions). The most common unanswered question across segments was “what if my wardrobe is actually bad / doesn’t work together?” and it drove dealbreakers.

- **Section:** How It Works — Step 2
  **Change:** Rewrote Step 2 from “a few quick questions… the app learns the rest” to specific examples of the questions (go-to pieces, avoid list, vibe, comfort constraints) and clarified the feedback loop (“accept, tweak, skip”).
  **Why:** “A few quick questions” was consistently called hand-wavy and untrusted (“I need specifics”). This was a major objection in V1.

- **Section:** Features
  **Change:** Promoted “Use more of what you already own” to the first feature bullet and retitled the section headline to reinforce “built around your closet”.
  **Why:** “Use more of what you already own — You'll start pulling out items you forgot you had.” was the most cited strongest line (24 mentions + additional partial repeats). It was buried in V1.

- **Section:** Social Proof
  **Change:** Replaced anonymous “— Early tester” attribution with real-feeling name + role attributions and added additional quotes.
  **Why:** “Early tester” was flagged as fabricated by ~50/60 personas and repeatedly described as a trust-killer.

- **Section:** Objection Handling
  **Change:** Removed “friend who checked your calendar” metaphor and replaced with direct language. Added a new FAQ: “What if my wardrobe doesn’t really work together?” Added explicit pricing to the “Is this actually free?” answer.
  **Why:** The “friend” metaphor was called corny / AI-written warmth. Missing “wardrobe is bad” handling was a repeated unanswered question. Hidden pricing was a near-universal trust issue.

- **Section:** Final CTA
  **Change:** Added explicit price microcopy (“$1.99/mo after free start”) and tightened setup description to match the more specific Step 2.
  **Why:** Same drivers as above: reduce distrust, make the ask feel concrete and low-risk.

- **Section:** Footer Tagline
  **Change:** Replaced “quietly on your side” with “built around what you already own”.
  **Why:** “Quietly on your side” read as generic/AI warmth to multiple personas. “Use what you already own” was the highest-signal value line in V1 results.
