## Changes from V2

- **Section:** Hero (price framing)
  **Change:** Kept CTA + price microcopy, and added a one-line explanation: “We’re keeping it cheap while we’re early — we’d rather earn trust than charge for potential.”
  **Why:** V2 revealed $1.99 (good), but a new recurring reaction emerged: “so cheap I trust it less / signals hobby project.” This line reframes low price as an intentional early-stage choice rather than a quality signal.

- **Section:** Problem
  **Change:** Pulled the most resonant V2 “testimonial” line (“Your closet is full of pieces you like, but you never know what actually goes together.”) into the main problem narrative as a first-class problem statement.
  **Why:** In V2 this sentence was the single most-cited strongest line (27 mentions) but was dismissed as fabricated social proof when attributed to a person. The wording works; the attribution didn’t. Moving it into the problem section keeps the signal without triggering distrust.

- **Section:** Credibility / Social Proof
  **Change:** Removed the “Credibility (What People Told Us)” pull-quote section entirely and replaced it with a concrete “What It Looks Like (Real Output)” section that shows two example outfit options with “why” reasoning and the actual user actions (accept / swap / hide).
  **Why:** V2 social proof failed at scale: most personas called the quotes fabricated (“Priya K., Marketing Director” read like placeholder social proof), and some segments (notably Vibe Coder Victor) flagged the all-women quotes as a targeting miss. Credibility needs to come from showing the product’s output and logic, not invented quotes.

- **Section:** New “What It Looks Like” proof block
  **Change:** Added an explicit example of a day (weather + events) with two outfit options and short “why” justifications.
  **Why:** V2 improved resonance but decreased intent overall (resonance +10pp, intent -5pp). The qualitative feedback pointed to a trust/mechanism gap: people relate to the problem but don’t believe the app can produce good suggestions. A sample output reduces abstraction and makes the promise testable.

- **Section:** How It Works — Step 2 (mechanism trust)
  **Change:** Kept the specific setup inputs and added an explicit optional path: “Do a quick closet scan with your phone camera… just enough to stop guessing.”
  **Why:** The most common V2 objection/unanswered question was “How does it actually know what I own from a 2-minute quiz?” Adding an optional scan aligns with the product’s core capability (closet scanning) and answers the mechanism question directly while still preserving low-friction onboarding.

- **Section:** Objection Handling — Calendar privacy
  **Change:** Added a new FAQ: “What exactly do you read from my Google Calendar?”
  **Why:** Calendar access was flagged as a privacy red flag in V2 (explicitly raised by Victor). Even if only a few say it out loud, it can silently block conversion. Addressing it reduces perceived risk at the exact moment you ask for Calendar permissions.

- **Section:** Corporate over-targeting cleanup
  **Change:** Kept the high-specificity example line (2pm meeting / 7pm drinks / 42°) but broadened the problem examples beyond purely corporate contexts (presentation, date, dinner, travel day).
  **Why:** V2 kept reading “for corporate office workers” to multiple segments. Broadening scenarios preserves specificity while reducing the “this is for someone else” rejection pattern (especially Sophia and Dana, plus parts of Rachel/Victor).
