The 'keeping it cheap while we're early' framing is a little try-hard \u2014 just say it's $1.99, I don't need the philosophy behind the pricing.",

Those aren't outfits, they're placeholders. Also 'show up looking intentional' is the kind of phrase that gets used when someone ran out of specific things to say.

The 2-minute setup claim feels optimistic to the point of dishonest. I've done enough 'quick setups' that turned into 30-minute rabbit holes.

What happens when I wear something that wasn't in its suggestion \u2014 does it learn from that? And is this a web app or native mobile, because that matters a lot for a morning routine tool.",
    "price_reaction": "$1.99 is so cheap it almost makes me trust it less \u2014 like they don't believe in it enough to charge real money. I'd actually feel better at $5-7/mo. But it removes price as a barrier to trying it, so fine.",
