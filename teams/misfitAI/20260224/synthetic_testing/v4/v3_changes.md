## Changes from V3

- **Section:** (None — copy unchanged)
  **Change:** V4 used the same copy as V3 (`v3_copy.md`). No edits to hero, problem, solution, how it works, features, objection handling, or CTA.
  **Why:** V3 had stabilized resonance (23%), intent (12%), and dealbreakers (33%). We ran V4 as a **stability check** — same audience, same copy — to confirm the metrics held before refocusing the test on the ICP. The goal was to validate that Victor and Rachel were the real best-fit segments and that Dana/Sophia/Paul were consistently poor fit before changing the audience.
