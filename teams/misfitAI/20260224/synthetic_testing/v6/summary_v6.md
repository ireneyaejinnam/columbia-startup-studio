## Key Themes (V6)

- **Resonance and intent** improved without any copy change — the same messaging lands better with the ICP when evaluated again; strongest lines remain “You don’t need more clothes. You need outfits that actually go together.” and “Does this look intentional, or just… random?”
- **Conversion confidence** remains 0%. Personas like the product and many would try it, but aren’t yet confident it will work for their real closet/context. Next iteration lever: proof it works (e.g. before/after, week-1 results) or clearer dress-code/context handling.
- **Price** ($1.99) continues to be accepted; “we’d rather earn trust than charge for potential” still reads as startup-speak to some but is not a dealbreaker driver.

## Bottom Line

V6 is the final copy for submission. Next steps: ship this version for landing and early traffic; iterate on conversion confidence with real users or a follow-up synthetic round focused on “proof it works” and context nuance.
