## Changes from V5

- **Section:** (None — copy unchanged)
  **Change:** V6 used the same copy as V5 (`v5_copy.md`). No edits to hero, problem, solution, how it works, features, objection handling, or CTA. Same ICP audience (audience_v2.json).
  **Why:** V5 had already hit the brief’s stopping criteria (intent ≥ 20%, dealbreakers 7%). We ran V6 to capture an additional round of qualitative feedback and to see if metrics held or improved with the same setup. No intentional copy or audience change — any delta is run-to-run variation and/or persona sampling.
