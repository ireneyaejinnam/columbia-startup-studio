# Synthetic Testing — Key Findings

**Product:** Wardrobe Planner  
**Final version:** V6 (`v6/v6_copy.md`)  
**Rounds:** 6 (V1–V4 broad audience; V5–V6 ICP-only)

---

## What resonated

- **“You don’t need more clothes. You need outfits that actually go together.”** — Consistently cited across rounds; problem framing that landed.
- **Concrete examples** — “Client meeting at 2pm and drinks at 7pm, matched to the 42° forecast” made the product feel real and specific.
- **Showing the price ($1.99/mo)** — Reduced suspicion; once visible, most personas called it a good deal.
- **“What it looks like” sample output** — Showing two example outfits with accept/swap/hide reduced the trust gap and boosted intent (V2→V3).
- **ICP refocus (V5–V6)** — Testing only Victor, Rachel, Priya, Owen, Sam doubled resonance and intent and cut dealbreakers (60% → 2%).

## What didn’t / key objections

- **Social proof** — Named testimonials (V2) were still read as fabricated; removing them and replacing with product output (V3) fixed the backlash.
- **“A few quick questions”** — Vague Step 2 hurt trust until we named specific inputs (go-to pieces, vibe, avoid list) and added optional closet scan.
- **Conversion confidence** — Still 0% Agree+ in every round. Personas get the offer and many say they’d try it, but don’t yet believe it will work for *their* closet/context.
- **Sample output style** — Read as “Pinterest-basic” by higher-taste segments (Paul, Sophia, Dana); that same clarity helped Victor and Rachel.

## Dealbreaker summary

- **V1:** 60% dealbreakers; Dana and Sophia were product mismatches (style identity, not decision reduction).
- **V3/V4:** Dropped to ~33–35% after removing fake testimonials and adding “what it looks like” + “wardrobe doesn’t work” FAQ.
- **V5 (ICP):** 7% dealbreakers; **V6:** 2% (1/60). Winning version is viable for the ICP; remaining gap is confidence the product will deliver, not a hard “no.”

---

## Price perception

- Hidden price (V1) was read as evasive. Showing $1.99 (V2+) fixed that; many then called it a “good deal.”
- “Why it’s $1.99” was sometimes read as startup-speak but did not drive dealbreakers.

## Recommendations

1. **Ship V6 copy** for landing and early traffic; it’s the best-performing version for the ICP.
2. **Improve conversion confidence** next: add proof it works (e.g. before/after, “week 1” results, or clearer dress-code handling).
3. **Don’t re-target** Dana/Sophia/Paul with this positioning; use this copy for Victor, Rachel, Priya, Owen, Sam.
