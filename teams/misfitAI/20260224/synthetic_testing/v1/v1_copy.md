# Wardrobe Planner — Landing Page Copy

***

## SECTION 1: Hero

**Headline:**
One less decision every morning.

**Subheadline:**
Wardrobe Planner looks at your calendar, checks the weather, and suggests exactly what to wear — built around your wardrobe, not someone else's.

**Primary CTA Button:**
Connect Your Google Calendar — It's Free

***

## SECTION 2: Problem (Relatable Pain)

**Section Headline:**
Sound familiar?

**Body Text:**
You open your calendar. You check the weather. You stare at your closet. Fifteen minutes later, you're wearing the same three outfits you always fall back on — and running late.

You're not bad at getting dressed. You're just doing it manually, every single morning, with zero help.

There's no tool that ties your 9am meeting, the rain forecast, and what's actually in your closet into one answer. Until now.

***

## SECTION 3: Solution

**Section Headline:**
Your schedule already knows what you need. Now your wardrobe does too.

**Body Text:**
Wardrobe Planner connects your Google Calendar and local weather to suggest complete, ready-to-wear outfits for your actual day. Not a fashion editorial. Not a generic mood board. A clear outfit for a client meeting at 2pm and drinks at 7pm, matched to the 42° forecast and what you already own.

***

## SECTION 4: How It Works

**Section Headline:**
Set up in minutes. Save time every morning.

***

**Step 1**
**Step Headline:** Connect your Google Calendar

**Body Text:**
Link your calendar once. Wardrobe Planner reads your upcoming events — meetings, gym sessions, dinners, travel days — and knows what kind of day you're having before you even think about your closet.

**CTA Button:** Connect Google Calendar →

***

**Step 2**
**Step Headline:** Tell us about your style and wardrobe

**Body Text:**
Answer a few quick questions about what you own and how you like to dress. No uploading photos of every item. No hour-long setup project. Just enough for us to get you started — the app learns the rest from what you actually wear.

***

**Step 3**
**Step Headline:** Wake up to your outfit

**Body Text:**
Each morning (or the night before), you'll see a small set of outfit suggestions matched to your day's events and the weather forecast. Tap to accept, swap one piece, or skip entirely. You're still in charge — we just handle the thinking.

***

## SECTION 5: Features / Why It Works

**Section Headline:**
Knows your weather, your plans, your comfort.

- **Weather-smart, wardrobe-aware** — Every suggestion accounts for today's actual forecast, not just the season.
- **Event-matched** — A casual Friday and a noon client lunch get different recommendations.
- **Use more of what you already own** — You'll start pulling out items you forgot you had.
- **One clear outfit that feels like you** — We don't flood you with options. We give you a confident pick.
- **You're always in control** — Accept it, tweak it, or ignore it. It's a starting point, not a command.

## SECTION 6: Social Proof

**Pull Quote:**
*"If my calendar and the weather could just spit out three outfit ideas every morning, I'd pay for that."*
— Early tester

***

## SECTION 7: Objection Handling ("You might be wondering...")

**Section Headline:**
You might be wondering...

***

**Q: Do I have to photograph my entire wardrobe to get started?**
A: No. You start with a quick style profile — a few questions about what you own and how you like to dress. That's it. Wardrobe Planner gets smarter the more you use it, without a big upfront project.

***

**Q: What if I want to make my own call on what to wear?**
A: You always do. Every suggestion is a starting point — accept it, swap one piece, or ignore it entirely. Think of it as a friend who's already checked your calendar and the forecast so you don't have to.

***

**Q: Is this actually free?**
A: Yes, to start. No credit card needed. Try it and see if it saves you real time and stress every morning. We'll earn your subscription once it becomes a habit you rely on.

***

## SECTION 8: Final CTA

**Section Headline:**
Get dressed with less effort, starting tomorrow.

**Body Text:**
Connect your Google Calendar, set your style preferences in minutes, and wake up to an outfit that's already been figured out.

**Primary CTA Button:** Start Your Free Wardrobe Plan

**Secondary CTA Button:** See How It Works

**Microcopy below buttons:** No credit card required · Takes under 5 minutes to set up · Works with your existing wardrobe

***

## SECTION 9: Footer Tagline

**Tagline:**

### Copy Rationale Notes

Here's how each section maps directly back to our strategy documents:

| No mention of "AI stylist" or "transforms your look" | Language to Avoid   |
| Step 2 explicitly addresses no photo catalog required | Objection handling + interview language   |
| "Starting point, not a command" framing in FAQ | Agency objection response   |
| Social proof quote used verbatim | Key interview evidence   |
| "Use more of what you already own" as a feature bullet | Canonical language   |
| Free/no credit card framing in FAQ | Pricing objection response + open questions   |
| Step count and flow (Calendar → Preferences → Morning suggestion) | User interaction flow   |
