# Brand Position Template

**Team Name: misFitAI**  
**Date: February 22, 2026**

**Purpose:** This is an internal document. It captures your brand's thesis, identity, and canonical language so that everything you build — landing page, copy, features, pitch — speaks with one voice. This is not marketing copy. It is a decision reference.

---

## Brand Thesis

What is the one-sentence emotional and philosophical anchor of your brand? This is the big idea, not a feature description.

> **Getting dressed should feel effortless and personalised, so your energy goes into living your day, not deciding what to wear.**

---

## Core Product Definition

Complete this sentence with maximum clarity:

> **Wardrobe Planner helps busy, calendar‑driven people get dressed with confidence by turning their schedule, weather, and wardrobe into simple, ready‑to‑wear outfit suggestions.**

This should be reusable verbatim anywhere you need to explain what your product does.

---

## Existence Statement

Why does this product exist? Not what it does, but why it needs to be in the world.

> **Wardrobe Planner exists to remove daily outfit decision fatigue and under‑dressing anxiety for people whose lives already run on their calendars.**

---

## Target Identity

Who is your user, described in aspirational but honest terms? Not demographics — identity.

> **Wardrobe Planner is for someone who treats their time and mental energy as scarce, wants to look appropriately put‑together, and would gladly outsource “what should I wear for today’s plans?” to a trusted helper.**

Example: "Morsel is for a brand leader who believes customer feedback is a growth engine, not a complaint box."

---

## Canonical Language

List 4-6 phrases that capture your brand voice. These are the words and phrases you use repeatedly across all surfaces.

- **“Built around your wardrobe, not someone else’s.”**
- **“One less decision in the morning.”**
- **“Knows your weather, your plans, your comfort.”**
- **“Weather‑smart, wardrobe‑aware.”**
- **“Use more of what you already own.”**
- **“One clear outfit that feels like you.”**

---

## Language to Avoid

What words or framings are off-brand? What do competitors say that you deliberately don't?

- **Avoid:** “AI stylist that transforms your look.” — **Because:** This sounds like a high‑fashion makeover; many target users just want to feel appropriately dressed and efficient, not to reinvent their style.
- **Avoid:** “We decide your outfits for you.” — **Because:** Several interviews show people want to preserve agency and creativity; we frame it as suggestions, not commands.
- **Avoid:** "Endless options." — **Because:** Decision fatigue is the core pain; we highlight fewer, smarter options (often a single confident pick) instead of more choice.

---

## Tone Guidelines

Describe your brand's voice in 3-4 short rules:

- Human‑centred not robotic — Sounds like a thoughtful, practical friend who knows your day, not a cold algorithm or corporate assistant.
- Supportive not controlling — Emphasizes that you’re still in charge; the app suggests, you choose.
- Simple not flashy — Uses clear, everyday language about time, energy, and weather rather than fashion jargon or hype.

Example: "Warm but not saccharine — genuine care without excessive emoji."

---

## Positioning Statement

Complete this sentence:

> **For busy, calendar‑driven students and professionals, Wardrobe Planner is the calendar‑connected wardrobe assistant that quietly handles “what should I wear for today?” because it combines your schedule, weather, and wardrobe into a few confident, low‑effort outfit suggestions.**

Example: "For brand leaders at growing DTC companies, Morsel is the feedback platform that turns customer voice into product decisions because it captures context traditional surveys miss."

---

## Brand Values

What 2-3 principles guide decisions when the team disagrees? These are tiebreakers, not aspirations.

- **Effortless first** — If a feature adds friction (more taps, uploads, decisions) without a clear spike in perceived ease, it loses. We optimize for the fastest path to “outfit decided.”
- **Respect the user’s taste** — The app should feel like it works with the user’s existing style, routines, and comfort, not against them; preserving agency beats over‑automation.
- **Real‑world usefulness over novelty** — We prioritize accuracy, weather‑appropriateness, and event‑fit over flashy AI tricks or fancy visuals that don’t change outcomes.

Example: "Transparency over polish — we'd rather ship something honest than something pretty."

---

## Objection Handling

What did skeptics say in your interviews? What are the top 2-3 reasons someone would say no, and how would you respond?

| Objection | Your Response |
|-----------|--------------|
| “I don’t want to spend time uploading or cataloging my whole closet.”  | We start with a lightweight wardrobe profile (a few questions and high‑level categories) and gradually learn from what you wear, so you get useful suggestions without a big upfront project.  |
| “I don’t want an app fully deciding my outfits; I like having control/creativity.” | The app gives you a small number of suggestions (often a single best pick) that you can accept, tweak, or swap—think of it as a starting point that protects your time, not a rulebook. |
| “I’m not sure I’d pay for this; it’s a nice‑to‑have.”  | We’re starting with a free or low‑friction model so you can experience the time and stress savings first; once it reliably saves you minutes and mistakes every week, we can justify a modest subscription. |
| “I’ve already simplified my wardrobe; I don’t feel much pain.” | Routine‑driven minimalists aren’t our primary focus; we’re intentionally designing for people with busier schedules and more varied wardrobes who feel daily decision fatigue. |

These feed directly into your landing page. The best copy preempts doubt before the reader has to voice it.

## Key Interview Language

Pull the 3-5 most vivid phrases from your interviews that should influence your copy. These are your users' actual words.

1. “You never know what’s in your wardrobe.” — Speaks to visibility and memory problems; supports messaging about “seeing” and using more of what you already own.
2. “It would take a lot of time to take pictures of your clothes.” — Explicit pushback against heavy onboarding; this should shape product constraints and be pre‑empted in onboarding copy.
3. “I wouldn’t want to lose agency completely.” / “It would feel robotic to me.” — Highlights the need to position the app as assistive, not controlling, especially in explaining the AI.
4. “Sometimes I’m just wondering if [this item] will go with most of my clothes.” — Shows the anxiety around matching and appropriateness, reinforcing value in smart suggestions over trial‑and‑error shopping.
