# Changes from V2

## Strategy

V2 dramatically improved clarity (3% → 78% nailed_it) but regressed on conversion (10% → 2%) and resonance (38% → 30%). Root cause: trying to broaden appeal to professional segments diluted the emotional resonance that drove early-adopter conversion, while the added method specificity triggered "but you don't have MY method" rejections.

V3 strategy: **restore what V1 did well (emotional resonance) while keeping what V2 did well (clarity, transparency framing).** Accept that budget_gatekeeper and skeptical_methodologist segments have product-level blockers that copy cannot resolve.

---

- **Section:** Problem
  **Change:** Removed the second paragraph ("Or maybe you know exactly what analysis you need — but you're stitching it together across SPSS, Excel, Word, and a shared drive..."). Restored V1's single-focus emotional narrative.
  **Why:** V2 added this paragraph to address duct_tape_analysts, but it split the emotional focus and contributed to ai_loop_prisoner resonance dropping 33pp (83% → 50%). The V1 problem section was the copy's strongest emotional moment — thesis_dreader and ai_loop_prisoner personas called it "uncomfortably accurate." The second paragraph diluted that by trying to also speak to a different persona.

- **Section:** Problem (closing line)
  **Change:** Replaced V2's closing ("Either way, the tools that exist today... were built to do one thing well in isolation. Not to take you from raw data to understood results in one place.") with a shorter version that bridges to the solution without over-explaining.
  **Why:** The V2 closing was analytical where V1 was visceral. The V1 "Not for you" had problems (alienated professionals), but the V2 replacement was too long and read like a product brief rather than empathic copy.

- **Section:** Solution (method list framing)
  **Change:** Added "including" and "and more" framing around method examples: "it selects the right method — Spearman or Pearson — based on your data" becomes "it selects the right method based on your data, shows you why, and lets you override it."
  **Why:** V2's specificity caused the "specificity trap" — thesis_dreader conversion collapsed 33% → 0% because listing correlation/regression/ANOVA/chi-square made personas realize their specific method (HLM, SEM, IRT) wasn't mentioned. V3 keeps the specificity (it helped clarity by 75pp) but frames listed methods as examples, not an exhaustive list.

- **Section:** Solution (qualitative analysis)
  **Change:** Expanded "Click 'Code'" section with more operational detail: what the output looks like, iteration workflow, and cross-case comparison.
  **Why:** 10+ personas across thesis_dreader, duct_tape_analyst, and ai_loop_prisoner said the qualitative section was the most interesting but had the least detail. "Emergent codes or bring your own codebook" wasn't enough to evaluate the capability.

- **Section:** Solution (capability ceiling signal)
  **Change:** Added a brief "And more" line after the method-specific bullets signaling that listed methods are not the full capability set.
  **Why:** Directly addresses the specificity trap. Personas who need HLM or SEM should understand this is an expanding platform, not a fixed list.

- **Section:** Your Data Stays Yours
  **Change:** Added specific encryption standard (AES-256), hosting detail (US-based cloud infrastructure), and explicit no-training policy. Removed "pursuing SOC 2 Type II" framing in favor of a direct statement about current security posture.
  **Why:** 7/12 budget_gatekeeper dealbreakers cited "pursuing SOC 2" as disqualifying — it crystallized the compliance gap into a concrete rejection point. V3 leads with what IS true now (encryption, data isolation, no-training) rather than what's aspirational. This won't convert budget_gatekeepers who need SOC 2, but it stops actively creating dealbreakers.

- **Section:** Objection Handling ("I already use Excel")
  **Change:** Minor tightening. No structural change.
  **Why:** This objection performed well in both versions.

- **Section:** Who It's For
  **Change:** Tightened the list. Removed "Research methodologists" and "Team leads" entries, which were added in V2 to appeal to skeptical_methodologist and budget_gatekeeper segments. Kept the expanded descriptions from V2 for remaining entries.
  **Why:** The "Research methodologists" bullet was called out by multiple skeptical_methodologists as "aspirational category placement" and by ai_loop_prisoners as "unconvincing." It tried to claim an audience the copy couldn't credibly serve. "Team leads" was flagged by budget_gatekeepers as evidence the copy was written for individuals, not buyers. Removing both makes the list more honest and focused.

- **Section:** Final CTA
  **Change:** Restored V1's direct emotional CTA ("Stop brute-forcing your analysis") instead of V2's "Stop stitching together your analysis across six tools."
  **Why:** V1's CTA was more emotionally resonant for the segments that actually convert. V2's CTA spoke to the duct_tape_analyst fragmentation problem, which isn't converting anyway.
