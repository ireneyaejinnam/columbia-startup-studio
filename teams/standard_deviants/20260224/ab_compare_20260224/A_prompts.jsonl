This isn't a replacement for Excel \u2014 it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.\n\n**\"Can I trust the results?\"**\nEvery analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, what assumptions were checked, and what the output means. Results are deterministic \u2014 same data, same output, every time. You can inspect every decision, override any method, and export the full audit trail.\n\n**\"I need to see the methodology.\"**\nThe platform documents every statistical decision: which test was selected, why, what alternatives were considered, and what would change if you chose differently. You can override any automated choice. This is transparent automation, not a black box.\n\n**\"My team uses multiple tools already.\"**\nImport from CSV, Excel, SPSS, Qualtrics, and Google Forms. Export to formats your existing workflow expects. The goal is to consolidate the analysis step \u2014 not to replace every tool you use, but to stop being the human translation layer between them.\n\n**\"I don't have budget for another tool.\"**\nThe free tier has no time limit. If you're spending $10-20/month on ChatGPT to debug R code, this replaces that.\n\n---\n\n## Final CTA\n\n**Stop brute-forcing your analysis.**\n\nUpload your data. Click a question.

Ready for your committee, your funder, or your board.\n\n---\n\n## Who It's For\n\n- **Graduate students** writing a thesis and dreading the analysis chapter \u2014 get from raw data to defensible results without learning R\n- **Program directors and evaluators** proving an intervention works, on deadline, with data spread across multiple tools\n- **UX and market researchers** synthesizing dozens of interviews into patterns and deliverables\n- **Consultants** who need credible analysis without a data team or a week of setup\n- **Anyone** who collects qualitative or quantitative data as part of work they care about \u2014 and wants to understand it without stitching together five different tools\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Upload** \u2014 drag in your CSV, Excel, SPSS, or interview transcripts\n2. **Clean** \u2014 map values, fix inconsistencies, handle missing data with point-and-click tools\n3. **Analyze** \u2014 click the question you want to answer; the platform picks the right method and shows you why\n4. **Visualize** \u2014 see correlations, distributions, regressions, and themes instantly\n5. **Export** \u2014 charts, tables, and full audit trails ready for papers, reports, or presentations\n\n---\n\n## Pricing\n\n**Free** \u2014 3 projects, core analysis features, unlimited exports\n\n**Pro \u2014 $10/month** \u2014 unlimited projects, advanced visualizations, collaboration, priority support\n\n**Team \u2014 $25/month** \u2014 everything in Pro plus shared workspaces, inter-rater reliability, and role-based permissions\n\n---\n\n## Your Data Stays Yours\n\nAll data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256) on US-based cloud infrastructure. Your data is isolated per account and never used to train models \u2014 period.\n\nYou control who has access, and you can delete your data at any time. If your organization requires a security review, DPA, or BAA before procurement, contact us \u2014 we'll walk through it with you.\n\n---\n\n## Objection Handling\n\n**\"I already use Excel.\"**\nSo does everyone. This isn't a replacement for Excel \u2014 it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.\n\n**\"Can I trust the results?\"**\nEvery analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, what assumptions were checked, and what the output means. Results are deterministic \u2014 same data, same output, every time. You can inspect every decision, override any method, and export the full audit trail.\n\n**\"I need to see the methodology.\"**\nThe platform documents every statistical decision: which test was selected, why, what alternatives were considered, and what would change if you chose differently. You can override any automated choice. This is transparent automation, not a black box.\n\n**\"My team uses multiple tools already.\"**\nImport from CSV, Excel, SPSS, Qualtrics, and Google Forms. Export to formats your existing workflow expects. The goal is to consolidate the analysis step \u2014 not to replace every tool you use, but to stop being the human translation layer between them.\n\n**\"I don't have budget for another tool.\"**\nThe free tier has no time limit. If you're spending $10-20/month on ChatGPT to debug R code, this replaces that.\n\n---\n\n## Final CTA\n\n**Stop brute-forcing your analysis.**\n\nUpload your data. Click a question.

If your organization requires a security review, DPA, or BAA before procurement, contact us \u2014 we'll walk through it with you.\n\n---\n\n## Objection Handling\n\n**\"I already use Excel.\"**\nSo does everyone. This isn't a replacement for Excel \u2014 it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.\n\n**\"Can I trust the results?\"**\nEvery analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, what assumptions were checked, and what the output means. Results are deterministic \u2014 same data, same output, every time. You can inspect every decision, override any method, and export the full audit trail.\n\n**\"I need to see the methodology.\"**\nThe platform documents every statistical decision: which test was selected, why, what alternatives were considered, and what would change if you chose differently. You can override any automated choice. This is transparent automation, not a black box.\n\n**\"My team uses multiple tools already.\"**\nImport from CSV, Excel, SPSS, Qualtrics, and Google Forms. Export to formats your existing workflow expects. The goal is to consolidate the analysis step \u2014 not to replace every tool you use, but to stop being the human translation layer between them.\n\n**\"I don't have budget for another tool.\"**\nThe free tier has no time limit. If you're spending $10-20/month on ChatGPT to debug R code, this replaces that.\n\n---\n\n## Final CTA\n\n**Stop brute-forcing your analysis.**\n\nUpload your data. Click a question.

This isn't a replacement for Excel \u2014 it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.\n\n**\"Can I trust the results?\"**\nEvery analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, what assumptions were checked, and what the output means. Results are deterministic \u2014 same data, same output, every time. You can inspect every decision, override any method, and export the full audit trail.\n\n**\"I need to see the methodology.\"**\nThe platform documents every statistical decision: which test was selected, why, what alternatives were considered, and what would change if you chose differently. You can override any automated choice. This is transparent automation, not a black box.\n\n**\"My team uses multiple tools already.\"**\nImport from CSV, Excel, SPSS, Qualtrics, and Google Forms. Export to formats your existing workflow expects. The goal is to consolidate the analysis step \u2014 not to replace every tool you use, but to stop being the human translation layer between them.\n\n**\"I don't have budget for another tool.\"**\nThe free tier has no time limit. If you're spending $10-20/month on ChatGPT to debug R code, this replaces that.\n\n---\n\n## Final CTA\n\n**Stop brute-forcing your analysis.**\n\nUpload your data. Click a question.

This isn't a replacement for Excel \u2014 it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.\n\n**\"Can I trust the results?\"**\nEvery analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, what assumptions were checked, and what the output means. Results are deterministic \u2014 same data, same output, every time. You can inspect every decision, override any method, and export the full audit trail.\n\n**\"I need to see the methodology.\"**\nThe platform documents every statistical decision: which test was selected, why, what alternatives were considered, and what would change if you chose differently. You can override any automated choice. This is transparent automation, not a black box.\n\n**\"My team uses multiple tools already.\"**\nImport from CSV, Excel, SPSS, Qualtrics, and Google Forms. Export to formats your existing workflow expects. The goal is to consolidate the analysis step \u2014 not to replace every tool you use, but to stop being the human translation layer between them.\n\n**\"I don't have budget for another tool.\"**\nThe free tier has no time limit. If you're spending $10-20/month on ChatGPT to debug R code, this replaces that.\n\n---\n\n## Final CTA\n\n**Stop brute-forcing your analysis.**\n\nUpload your data. Click a question.

If your organization requires a security review, DPA, or BAA before procurement, contact us \u2014 we'll walk through it with you.\n\n---\n\n## Objection Handling\n\n**\"I already use Excel.\"**\nSo does everyone. This isn't a replacement for Excel \u2014 it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.\n\n**\"Can I trust the results?\"**\nEvery analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, what assumptions were checked, and what the output means. Results are deterministic \u2014 same data, same output, every time. You can inspect every decision, override any method, and export the full audit trail.\n\n**\"I need to see the methodology.\"**\nThe platform documents every statistical decision: which test was selected, why, what alternatives were considered, and what would change if you chose differently. You can override any automated choice. This is transparent automation, not a black box.\n\n**\"My team uses multiple tools already.\"**\nImport from CSV, Excel, SPSS, Qualtrics, and Google Forms. Export to formats your existing workflow expects. The goal is to consolidate the analysis step \u2014 not to replace every tool you use, but to stop being the human translation layer between them.\n\n**\"I don't have budget for another tool.\"**\nThe free tier has no time limit. If you're spending $10-20/month on ChatGPT to debug R code, this replaces that.\n\n---\n\n## Final CTA\n\n**Stop brute-forcing your analysis.**\n\nUpload your data. Click a question.

This isn't a replacement for Excel \u2014 it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.\n\n**\"Can I trust the results?\"**\nEvery analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, what assumptions were checked, and what the output means. Results are deterministic \u2014 same data, same output, every time. You can inspect every decision, override any method, and export the full audit trail.\n\n**\"I need to see the methodology.\"**\nThe platform documents every statistical decision: which test was selected, why, what alternatives were considered, and what would change if you chose differently. You can override any automated choice. This is transparent automation, not a black box.\n\n**\"My team uses multiple tools already.\"**\nImport from CSV, Excel, SPSS, Qualtrics, and Google Forms. Export to formats your existing workflow expects. The goal is to consolidate the analysis step \u2014 not to replace every tool you use, but to stop being the human translation layer between them.\n\n**\"I don't have budget for another tool.\"**\nThe free tier has no time limit. If you're spending $10-20/month on ChatGPT to debug R code, this replaces that.\n\n---\n\n## Final CTA\n\n**Stop brute-forcing your analysis.**\n\nUpload your data. Click a question.

This isn't a replacement for Excel \u2014 it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.\n\n**\"Can I trust the results?\"**\nEvery analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, what assumptions were checked, and what the output means. Results are deterministic \u2014 same data, same output, every time. You can inspect every decision, override any method, and export the full audit trail.\n\n**\"I need to see the methodology.\"**\nThe platform documents every statistical decision: which test was selected, why, what alternatives were considered, and what would change if you chose differently. You can override any automated choice. This is transparent automation, not a black box.\n\n**\"My team uses multiple tools already.\"**\nImport from CSV, Excel, SPSS, Qualtrics, and Google Forms. Export to formats your existing workflow expects. The goal is to consolidate the analysis step \u2014 not to replace every tool you use, but to stop being the human translation layer between them.\n\n**\"I don't have budget for another tool.\"**\nThe free tier has no time limit.

This isn't a replacement for Excel \u2014 it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.\n\n**\"Can I trust the results?\"**\nEvery analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, what assumptions were checked, and what the output means. Results are deterministic \u2014 same data, same output, every time. You can inspect every decision, override any method, and export the full audit trail.\n\n**\"I need to see the methodology.\"**\nThe platform documents every statistical decision: which test was selected, why, what alternatives were considered, and what would change if you chose differently. You can override any automated choice. This is transparent automation, not a black box.\n\n**\"My team uses multiple tools already.\"**\nImport from CSV, Excel, SPSS, Qualtrics, and Google Forms. Export to formats your existing workflow expects. The goal is to consolidate the analysis step \u2014 not to replace every tool you use, but to stop being the human translation layer between them.\n\n**\"I don't have budget for another tool.\"**\nThe free tier has no time limit. If you're spending $10-20/month on ChatGPT to debug R code, this replaces that.\n\n---\n\n## Final CTA\n\n**Stop brute-forcing your analysis.**\n\nUpload your data. Click a question.

This isn't a replacement for Excel \u2014 it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.\n\n**\"Can I trust the results?\"**\nEvery analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, what assumptions were checked, and what the output means. Results are deterministic \u2014 same data, same output, every time. You can inspect every decision, override any method, and export the full audit trail.\n\n**\"I need to see the methodology.\"**\nThe platform documents every statistical decision: which test was selected, why, what alternatives were considered, and what would change if you chose differently. You can override any automated choice. This is transparent automation, not a black box.\n\n**\"My team uses multiple tools already.\"**\nImport from CSV, Excel, SPSS, Qualtrics, and Google Forms. Export to formats your existing workflow expects. The goal is to consolidate the analysis step \u2014 not to replace every tool you use, but to stop being the human translation layer between them.\n\n**\"I don't have budget for another tool.\"**\nThe free tier has no time limit. If you're spending $10-20/month on ChatGPT to debug R code, this replaces that.\n\n---\n\n## Final CTA\n\n**Stop brute-forcing your analysis.**\n\nUpload your data. Click a question.

If your organization requires a security review, DPA, or BAA before procurement, contact us \u2014 we'll walk through it with you.\n\n---\n\n## Objection Handling\n\n**\"I already use Excel.\"**\nSo does everyone. This isn't a replacement for Excel \u2014 it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.\n\n**\"Can I trust the results?\"**\nEvery analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, what assumptions were checked, and what the output means. Results are deterministic \u2014 same data, same output, every time. You can inspect every decision, override any method, and export the full audit trail.\n\n**\"I need to see the methodology.\"**\nThe platform documents every statistical decision: which test was selected, why, what alternatives were considered, and what would change if you chose differently. You can override any automated choice. This is transparent automation, not a black box.\n\n**\"My team uses multiple tools already.\"**\nImport from CSV, Excel, SPSS, Qualtrics, and Google Forms. Export to formats your existing workflow expects. The goal is to consolidate the analysis step \u2014 not to replace every tool you use, but to stop being the human translation layer between them.\n\n**\"I don't have budget for another tool.\"**\nThe free tier has no time limit. If you're spending $10-20/month on ChatGPT to debug R code, this replaces that.\n\n---\n\n## Final CTA\n\n**Stop brute-forcing your analysis.**\n\nUpload your data. Click a question.

This isn't a replacement for Excel \u2014 it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.\n\n**\"Can I trust the results?\"**\nEvery analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, what assumptions were checked, and what the output means. Results are deterministic \u2014 same data, same output, every time. You can inspect every decision, override any method, and export the full audit trail.\n\n**\"I need to see the methodology.\"**\nThe platform documents every statistical decision: which test was selected, why, what alternatives were considered, and what would change if you chose differently. You can override any automated choice. This is transparent automation, not a black box.\n\n**\"My team uses multiple tools already.\"**\nImport from CSV, Excel, SPSS, Qualtrics, and Google Forms. Export to formats your existing workflow expects. The goal is to consolidate the analysis step \u2014 not to replace every tool you use, but to stop being the human translation layer between them.\n\n**\"I don't have budget for another tool.\"**\nThe free tier has no time limit.

Ready for your committee, your funder, or your board.\n\n---\n\n## Who It's For\n\n- **Graduate students** writing a thesis and dreading the analysis chapter \u2014 get from raw data to defensible results without learning R\n- **Program directors and evaluators** proving an intervention works, on deadline, with data spread across multiple tools\n- **UX and market researchers** synthesizing dozens of interviews into patterns and deliverables\n- **Consultants** who need credible analysis without a data team or a week of setup\n- **Anyone** who collects qualitative or quantitative data as part of work they care about \u2014 and wants to understand it without stitching together five different tools\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Upload** \u2014 drag in your CSV, Excel, SPSS, or interview transcripts\n2. **Clean** \u2014 map values, fix inconsistencies, handle missing data with point-and-click tools\n3. **Analyze** \u2014 click the question you want to answer; the platform picks the right method and shows you why\n4. **Visualize** \u2014 see correlations, distributions, regressions, and themes instantly\n5. **Export** \u2014 charts, tables, and full audit trails ready for papers, reports, or presentations\n\n---\n\n## Pricing\n\n**Free** \u2014 3 projects, core analysis features, unlimited exports\n\n**Pro \u2014 $10/month** \u2014 unlimited projects, advanced visualizations, collaboration, priority support\n\n**Team \u2014 $25/month** \u2014 everything in Pro plus shared workspaces, inter-rater reliability, and role-based permissions\n\n---\n\n## Your Data Stays Yours\n\nAll data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256) on US-based cloud infrastructure. Your data is isolated per account and never used to train models \u2014 period.\n\nYou control who has access, and you can delete your data at any time. If your organization requires a security review, DPA, or BAA before procurement, contact us \u2014 we'll walk through it with you.\n\n---\n\n## Objection Handling\n\n**\"I already use Excel.\"**\nSo does everyone. This isn't a replacement for Excel \u2014 it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.\n\n**\"Can I trust the results?\"**\nEvery analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, what assumptions were checked, and what the output means. Results are deterministic \u2014 same data, same output, every time. You can inspect every decision, override any method, and export the full audit trail.\n\n**\"I need to see the methodology.\"**\nThe platform documents every statistical decision: which test was selected, why, what alternatives were considered, and what would change if you chose differently. You can override any automated choice. This is transparent automation, not a black box.\n\n**\"My team uses multiple tools already.\"**\nImport from CSV, Excel, SPSS, Qualtrics, and Google Forms. Export to formats your existing workflow expects. The goal is to consolidate the analysis step \u2014 not to replace every tool you use, but to stop being the human translation layer between them.\n\n**\"I don't have budget for another tool.\"**\nThe free tier has no time limit. If you're spending $10-20/month on ChatGPT to debug R code, this replaces that.\n\n---\n\n## Final CTA\n\n**Stop brute-forcing your analysis.**\n\nUpload your data. Click a question.

This isn't a replacement for Excel \u2014 it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.\n\n**\"Can I trust the results?\"**\nEvery analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, what assumptions were checked, and what the output means. Results are deterministic \u2014 same data, same output, every time. You can inspect every decision, override any method, and export the full audit trail.\n\n**\"I need to see the methodology.\"**\nThe platform documents every statistical decision: which test was selected, why, what alternatives were considered, and what would change if you chose differently. You can override any automated choice. This is transparent automation, not a black box.\n\n**\"My team uses multiple tools already.\"**\nImport from CSV, Excel, SPSS, Qualtrics, and Google Forms. Export to formats your existing workflow expects. The goal is to consolidate the analysis step \u2014 not to replace every tool you use, but to stop being the human translation layer between them.\n\n**\"I don't have budget for another tool.\"**\nThe free tier has no time limit. If you're spending $10-20/month on ChatGPT to debug R code, this replaces that.\n\n---\n\n## Final CTA\n\n**Stop brute-forcing your analysis.**\n\nUpload your data. Click a question.

This isn't a replacement for Excel \u2014 it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.\n\n**\"Can I trust the results?\"**\nEvery analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, what assumptions were checked, and what the output means. Results are deterministic \u2014 same data, same output, every time. You can inspect every decision, override any method, and export the full audit trail.\n\n**\"I need to see the methodology.\"**\nThe platform documents every statistical decision: which test was selected, why, what alternatives were considered, and what would change if you chose differently. You can override any automated choice. This is transparent automation, not a black box.\n\n**\"My team uses multiple tools already.\"**\nImport from CSV, Excel, SPSS, Qualtrics, and Google Forms. Export to formats your existing workflow expects. The goal is to consolidate the analysis step \u2014 not to replace every tool you use, but to stop being the human translation layer between them.\n\n**\"I don't have budget for another tool.\"**\nThe free tier has no time limit.

Ready for your committee, your funder, or your board.\n\n---\n\n## Who It's For\n\n- **Graduate students** writing a thesis and dreading the analysis chapter \u2014 get from raw data to defensible results without learning R\n- **Program directors and evaluators** proving an intervention works, on deadline, with data spread across multiple tools\n- **UX and market researchers** synthesizing dozens of interviews into patterns and deliverables\n- **Consultants** who need credible analysis without a data team or a week of setup\n- **Anyone** who collects qualitative or quantitative data as part of work they care about \u2014 and wants to understand it without stitching together five different tools\n\n---\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Upload** \u2014 drag in your CSV, Excel, SPSS, or interview transcripts\n2. **Clean** \u2014 map values, fix inconsistencies, handle missing data with point-and-click tools\n3. **Analyze** \u2014 click the question you want to answer; the platform picks the right method and shows you why\n4. **Visualize** \u2014 see correlations, distributions, regressions, and themes instantly\n5. **Export** \u2014 charts, tables, and full audit trails ready for papers, reports, or presentations\n\n---\n\n## Pricing\n\n**Free** \u2014 3 projects, core analysis features, unlimited exports\n\n**Pro \u2014 $10/month** \u2014 unlimited projects, advanced visualizations, collaboration, priority support\n\n**Team \u2014 $25/month** \u2014 everything in Pro plus shared workspaces, inter-rater reliability, and role-based permissions\n\n---\n\n## Your Data Stays Yours\n\nAll data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256) on US-based cloud infrastructure. Your data is isolated per account and never used to train models \u2014 period.\n\nYou control who has access, and you can delete your data at any time. If your organization requires a security review, DPA, or BAA before procurement, contact us \u2014 we'll walk through it with you.\n\n---\n\n## Objection Handling\n\n**\"I already use Excel.\"**\nSo does everyone. This isn't a replacement for Excel \u2014 it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.\n\n**\"Can I trust the results?\"**\nEvery analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, what assumptions were checked, and what the output means. Results are deterministic \u2014 same data, same output, every time. You can inspect every decision, override any method, and export the full audit trail.\n\n**\"I need to see the methodology.\"**\nThe platform documents every statistical decision: which test was selected, why, what alternatives were considered, and what would change if you chose differently. You can override any automated choice. This is transparent automation, not a black box.\n\n**\"My team uses multiple tools already.\"**\nImport from CSV, Excel, SPSS, Qualtrics, and Google Forms. Export to formats your existing workflow expects. The goal is to consolidate the analysis step \u2014 not to replace every tool you use, but to stop being the human translation layer between them.\n\n**\"I don't have budget for another tool.\"**\nThe free tier has no time limit. If you're spending $10-20/month on ChatGPT to debug R code, this replaces that.\n\n---\n\n## Final CTA\n\n**Stop brute-forcing your analysis.**\n\nUpload your data. Click a question.
