## PROBLEM

**Section header:** The gap between having data and understanding it

You have the data. You might even know what question you're trying to answer. The problem is everything in between.

Maybe you're copying your interview transcripts into an AI chat, asking it to find themes, pasting the output into a doc, and quietly hoping it's right. Then you get an error. You paste the error back in. You wait. You're not sure if the output is right, but you don't know enough to tell. So you iterate. And iterate. And somewhere in the fifth round of that, you lose the thread of what you were actually trying to find out.

Maybe you're running surveys in one tool, cleaning data in a spreadsheet, running a test in SPSS or R, and writing up findings in a doc — four applications, six export steps, and no single place where the full picture lives.

Maybe you're a grad student with a 400-row dataset and an analysis chapter due in six weeks, and your methods section is a placeholder that just says *"TBD — figure this out."*

Maybe you've been doing this for fifteen years, and you're good at it, but the overhead is killing you. You know exactly what the data needs. Getting it there takes twice as long as it should.

The gap isn't your skills. It's the workflow.

## SOLUTION

**Section header:** From raw data to understood results — in one place

Standard Deviants is a web-based analysis platform that handles qualitative and quantitative data in the same workspace. Upload what you have. Tell us what you're trying to understand. The platform identifies the appropriate method, runs the analysis, and explains what the result means — in plain language, not output tables.

**The thing that matters most:**
Every result shows the method used, the parameters, the assumptions checked, and what it means in plain language.

You're not trusting a black box. You're seeing the work. If something doesn't look right, you can understand why — and change it.

**The Receipt:**
Every decision has a record. Every edit, recalculation, and method choice is tracked in a navigable history we call the Receipt. You can step backward through your analysis, see exactly what changed and when, and share that record with anyone who needs to verify your work. Your dissertation committee. Your client. Your IRB. Your skeptical director of analytics.

**Starting points, not ceilings:**
The platform doesn't hand you a fixed list of methods and call it done. It starts with what fits your data and your question — and you stay in control of what happens next. The goal is to get you to an answer you understand and can defend, not to impress you with a menu.

**Qualitative and quantitative, together:**
Thematic analysis on interview transcripts. Descriptive statistics on survey responses. Correlation between what people said and what they did. All of it, in one place, without switching tools or losing context. This is the gap NVivo and SPSS leave open. Standard Deviants sits in it.

## WHO IT'S FOR

**Section header:** Built for people who think in questions, not syntax

**The thesis dreader**
You have the data. You have the question. You have six weeks and a methods chapter that's still a placeholder. You need results you can explain to your committee, a clear record of how you got there, and enough confidence to defend your choices. You don't need to become a statistician. You need to get through this.

**The duct-tape analyst**
You've built a workflow across four tools because no single tool does everything. You're competent, maybe even expert — the overhead is just relentless. You're spending more time moving data between applications than actually thinking about what it means. You want one place where the work actually lives.

**The AI loop prisoner**
You found a workaround. Paste the data in, ask for themes, get output, paste the output somewhere else, repeat. It works, sort of. But you're never quite sure if the output is right, you can't reproduce it, and if anyone asks you to show your work, you're stuck. There has to be a better way to do this.

**The experienced analyst who values understanding**
You know R. You know SPSS. You've been doing this long enough to know when an output is wrong, even if the software didn't flag it. What you don't want is a platform that hides the method and hands you a number. You want to see the work — every assumption, every parameter, every decision. That's what Standard Deviants gives you.

**The UX or insights researcher**
You run studies, you collect transcripts, you build codebooks, you synthesize. Sometimes you do it alone. Sometimes with a team, which means reconciling multiple people's tags and themes and that's its own kind of mess. You need a platform that handles collaborative qualitative work at scale, not a workaround involving shared spreadsheets and hope.

**The product team doing scrappy research**
You didn't plan to become a research operation. You ran a few user interviews, sent a survey, maybe pulled some usage data — and now you have a pile of inputs and a decision to make by Thursday. You need something fast, legible, and defensible enough to share with leadership. You don't have time to become a methods expert.

## HOW IT WORKS

**Section header:** Upload. Clean. Analyze. Understand. Share.

**1. Upload what you have**
Interviews, transcripts, survey exports, CSV files, spreadsheets. Qualitative, quantitative, or both. The platform accepts what you actually have — not a perfectly formatted version of it.

**2. Clean without losing your mind**
Inconsistent responses, blank rows, duplicate entries — the platform flags issues and walks you through them. You decide what to do. Nothing is changed without your knowledge.

**3. Analyze with method transparency**
Tell the platform what you're trying to understand. It identifies the appropriate approach, explains why that method fits your data, runs the analysis, and surfaces the results. Every parameter is visible. Every assumption is checked. You see the work.

**4. Read results, not output tables**
The platform translates statistical output and qualitative findings into plain language. Not "p = 0.03" in isolation. "This relationship is statistically significant — here's what that means for your question and what it doesn't tell you."

**5. Export, share, and prove your work**
Export results in formats your audience can read. Share a live view with collaborators or clients. Hand anyone the Receipt — the complete, navigable record of every decision in your analysis — whenever they ask how you got there.

## SOCIAL PROOF

**Section header:** From people doing this work

---

*"I used NVivo for three years. It's powerful, but it only does half the job — and the other half lives in a spreadsheet somewhere. The first time I ran a mixed-methods analysis in Standard Deviants and saw the qual and quant side by side in one view, I genuinely just sat there for a second."*

**— UX Research Lead, mid-size tech company**

---

*"My advisor kept asking me to justify my method choices. I kept not being able to. With Standard Deviants, I could literally hand her the Receipt and say: here's every decision, here's why the platform flagged that approach as appropriate, here's what I changed and when. That conversation went differently."*

**— Doctoral candidate, educational psychology**

---

*"I've tried using AI to analyze interview data and it works until it doesn't — and the problem is you can't always tell which one you're in. Standard Deviants is the first thing I've used where I actually understand what it did and why, so I can stand behind the findings when I present them."*

**— Independent consultant, program evaluation**

## OBJECTION HANDLING

**Section header:** Things you're probably wondering

**"How do I know the analysis is right?"**
You can see exactly what the platform did. Every result shows the method, the parameters, the assumptions it checked before running, and an explanation of what the output means. You're not trusting output — you're reading work. If something looks off, the Receipt lets you trace back through every decision to find out why.

**"I already have tools that do parts of this."**
Most people do. The problem isn't that those tools are bad — it's that four tools means four workflows, four export steps, and four places where something can get lost or misaligned. Standard Deviants is one place where the full analysis lives, from raw data to final findings.

**"I've tried other platforms and they didn't stick."**
That's usually because the platform required you to already know what you were doing. Standard Deviants doesn't start by asking you to pick a method — it starts by asking what you're trying to understand. The difference matters.

**"What about my existing R/SPSS/Python workflow?"**
Export at any point. Standard Deviants outputs in formats that work with the tools you already use. If you want to pull results into R for further analysis or bring in data from SPSS, it's not a closed system. Your existing work doesn't disappear.

**"Is this going to be another tool I'm paying for and not using?"**
Start free. Three projects, core analysis features, unlimited exports. You'll know within your first project whether this changes how you work.
