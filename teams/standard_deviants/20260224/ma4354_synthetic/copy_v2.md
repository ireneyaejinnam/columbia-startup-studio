# SynthetiQ: The AI Qualitative Partner Built for Deep Research & Absolute Compliance

## Turn Months of Interviews into Weeks of Actionable Insight
SynthetiQ is the only AI qualitative research platform that combines the speed of automated synthesis with the rigor of a methodological audit trail. Built from the ground up for researchers in regulated and academic environments.

### The "Synthesis Gap" Ends Here
You didn't become a researcher to spend your nights in transcription hell. The manual grind isn't just exhausting—it's creating a bottleneck that keeps your most critical insights locked away for weeks. But generic AI is too fast, too thin, and too risky.

### Rigorous AI That Speaks "Researcher"
SynthetiQ doesn't just summarize; it synthesizes. Our workflow-aware AI understands the specific context of your study, providing the evidence behind every theme.

- **Methodological Audit Trail:** Every AI-generated theme is linked back to the raw transcript. See the evidence for every claim.
- **Cross-Role Comparison:** Automatically see how executives, operators, and end-users describe the same problem differently.
- **Persistent Study Memory:** Unlike generic LLMs, SynthetiQ maintains a secure context window across your entire study, perfect for longitudinal research.
- **Native R/JSON & CRM Exports:** Export your coded data directly into R-friendly formats or sync insights bi-directionally with Salesforce and HubSpot.

### Security Isn't an Afterthought—It's Our Foundation
We know your data is sensitive. That's why SynthetiQ is built for the strictest regulatory standards.

- **VPC Deployment:** Run SynthetiQ in your own virtual private cloud—your data never leaves your perimeter.
- **Zero-Trust Architecture:** Your data never touches a public LLM.
- **SOC2 & HIPAA Compliant:** Built to meet the requirements of Healthcare, Finance, and Government.
