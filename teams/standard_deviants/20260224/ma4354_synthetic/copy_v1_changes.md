## Changes from V1

- **Section:** Hero
  **Change:** Removed "20 minutes" hard claim. Replaced with "Turn months of research into weeks of insight."
  **Why:** Compliance Hawks and Skeptical Vets found "20 minutes" to be unbelievable or "snake oil" for serious qualitative work.

- **Section:** Features
  **Change:** Added "Methodological Audit Trail" and "R/JSON Exports".
  **Why:** Academics (TRK) need data integration with R/Python, and Hawks need to see *how* the AI arrived at a theme for reproducibility.

- **Section:** Security
  **Change:** Added "Bi-directional CRM Sync (Salesforce/HubSpot)".
  **Why:** John (CFO type) specifically mentioned that Salesforce is the digital Rolodex and if it doesn't plug in, it's just another silo.

- **Section:** Tone
  **Change:** Shifted from "Agile/Fast" to "Rigorous/Secure".
  **Why:** To address the "skeptical vet" and "compliance hawk" skepticism about the tool's depth.
