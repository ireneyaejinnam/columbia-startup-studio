## The Brief Is Too Big

A full QDA platform with cleaning, coding, collaboration, IRR, statistical analysis, and visualization is NVivo's game, and NVivo has a 30-year head start. John was right: don't try to be an all-in-one platform.

But the interviews revealed something more interesting than the brief describes.

## The Real Pain

The sharpest pain wasn't "I need a better coding tool" or "I need collaboration." It was this moment, which showed up in both GREEN interviews:

> *I have data. I have a question. I cannot get from one to the other without skills I don't have.*

AP4533 was "brute forcing" analysis, consulting four professors to find the right statistical test, and couldn't tell K-means clustering was useless until they *saw* the visualization. TRK2121-02 was pasting R errors into ChatGPT in a loop, doing work that was "unthinkable" before AI but still uncontrollable.

They don't need a better NVivo. They need **the thing that sits between "I have data" and "I understand my data."**

## Canva for Data Analysis

Not dumbed down — restructured. Canva didn't beat Photoshop by having fewer features. It won by organizing around the user's mental model (I need a poster) instead of the tool's mental model (layers, masks, channels). Same idea here:

- The researcher thinks: "Is there a correlation between X and Y?"
- The tool should answer that with a click — picking the right test (Spearman vs. Pearson), running it, showing the result, and visualizing it
- Not "here's an R console, good luck"

## The Wedge: Guided Analysis

The entry point is guided analysis, not qualitative coding. Specifically:

1. **Upload anything** — CSV, Excel, interview transcripts, survey exports
2. **Click to analyze** — the product chooses the right method based on the data types. Correlation? It picks Spearman or Pearson. Categorical comparison? Chi-square. The researcher doesn't need to know the method name.
3. **See it to believe it** — visualization isn't a feature, it's the primary interface. AP4533 couldn't evaluate their own work until they saw the chart. That's not an edge case; that's how these users think.
4. **Explain what it means** — not just "p = 0.03" but "this correlation is statistically significant, here's what that means for your research question"

Qualitative coding, collaboration, IRR — those can come later. But the entry point, the thing that gets you to 1,000 users through word of mouth in academic departments, is the moment a PhD student uploads a messy spreadsheet and *understands their data for the first time without writing a line of code.*

## The Growth Loop

AP4533 offered to pitch it in their senior seminar the next day. That's the growth loop: one student in a methods class shows it to the rest. That doesn't happen with "a better NVivo." It happens with "holy shit, there's a correlate button."

## The Risks

**The risk of going broader (full QDA platform)** is that you build something nobody switches to. TRK2121-01 said it plainly: "inertia." Researchers won't switch six tools for a tool that does all six things okay. But they'll *add* a tool that does one thing they currently can't do at all — go from data to insight without coding.

**The risk of going narrower (guided analysis only)** is that it feels like a toy. But Canva felt like a toy too, until it didn't. Ship the wedge. Prove the value. Expand from there.
