# Synthetic User Test Brief — Landing Page Copy (V1)

- **Owner:** mhk2182
- **Date:** 2026-02-24
- **Test:** Landing page messaging for Coquali

## What we’re testing
We’re testing whether the V1 landing page copy communicates Coquali’s value clearly and persuasively to different qualitative research segments, and whether it drives intent to try / join a waitlist.

## Product description (for clarity scoring)
Coquali is a collaborative qualitative analysis platform that turns raw interviews into coded, visual, and actionable insight.

## Audience buckets (5 segments)
**bucket_1 — Power qual practitioners**
Experienced UX/insights/research ops people doing lots of qual work; care about collaboration, rigor, and traceability.

**bucket_2 — Deadline-driven researchers**
Students/PhDs/policy folks under time pressure; want structure, defensibility, and a workflow that doesn’t collapse.

**bucket_3 — Fast-moving product teams**
PMs/designers/founders doing scrappy research; want speed, lightweight setup, and clear outputs to share.

**bucket_4 — Program evaluation + compliance-ish**
Nonprofit/healthcare/gov evaluators; care about consistency, audit trail, and reporting-ready outputs.

**bucket_5 — Tool owners / skeptics**
Ops directors, heads of insights, senior consultants; care about onboarding, governance, exports, and “show me it’s real.”

## Evaluation schema
Use the canonical evaluation schema from `references/evaluation-schemas.md` (60 persona eval objects). One persona per LLM call. Results compiled into `results_v1.json`.

## Success criteria
- High clarity (they understand what Coquali does)
- High resonance (copy speaks to their lived pain)
- High intent + conversion confidence (willing to click CTA / request access)
- Identify recurring objections + dealbreakers for iteration
