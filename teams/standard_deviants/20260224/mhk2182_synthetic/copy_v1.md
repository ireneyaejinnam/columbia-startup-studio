Landing Page — Coquali
Section 1: Hero
Headline

Turn interviews into real insight — without the spreadsheet chaos.

Sub-headline

Coquali gives you one collaborative workspace to upload transcripts, build a shared codebook, tag responses, and see patterns instantly. No copy-paste workflows. No version confusion. Just themes you can actually defend.

Primary CTA

Start analyzing in minutes

Section 2: How It Works
Upload your data once

Drop in interviews, open-ended survey responses, or field notes and keep everything in a single place. No more bouncing between Docs, Sheets, slides, and personal folders.

Build a codebook your whole team shares

Define codes once and keep everyone aligned. Update definitions without losing consistency across projects or collaborators.

Tag → filter → see patterns instantly

Highlight quotes, apply codes, and immediately explore what’s recurring. Move from raw text to clear themes in minutes instead of hours.

Trace every insight back to the source

Every finding is connected to the exact supporting quotes, so stakeholders can see where it came from and trust the result.

Section 3: Social Proof (Voice of the User)

“Synthesis used to mean a week of copy-pasting into spreadsheets. Now I can show patterns the same day the interviews finish.”
— UX Researcher, early-stage startup

“Our codebook kept drifting across projects. This is the first time the whole team is actually using the same system.”
— Research coordinator, public health lab

“I don’t need another notes tool. I need something that gets me from calls to defensible themes fast — this does that.”
— Product manager, B2B SaaS

Section 4: Objection Handling
“We already use Docs and Sheets — it works.”

It works until you have more than one project or more than one person. Coquali keeps your codebook, quotes, and themes in sync so your workflow scales instead of breaking.

“I don’t have time to learn heavy research software.”

If you know how to highlight text, you know how to use Coquali. The workflow mirrors what you already do — just without the manual overhead.

“Qualitative insights are hard to defend to stakeholders.”

Every theme links directly to the raw data behind it. When someone asks “where did this come from?” you can show them instantly.
