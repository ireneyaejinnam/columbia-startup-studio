# Brand Position

**Team Name:** Standard Deviants
**Date:** 2026-02-19

**Purpose:** This is an internal document. It captures our brand's thesis, identity, and canonical language so that everything we build — landing page, copy, features, pitch — speaks with one voice. This is not marketing copy. It is a decision reference.

---

## Brand Thesis

> **The gap between collecting data and understanding it shouldn't require learning to code, hiring a statistician, or duct-taping six tools together.**

---

## Core Product Definition

> **[Product] helps people who work with qualitative data make sense of it by replacing their fragmented tool stack with a single point-and-click analysis platform.**

---

## Existence Statement

> **[Product] exists because the people asking the hardest questions — about human behavior, public health, education, program outcomes, user experience — deserve a real tool, not a workaround.**

---

## Target Identity

> **[Product] is for someone who collects interviews, surveys, or open-ended data as part of work they care deeply about — and dreads the moment they have to analyze it.**

---

## Canonical Language

- **"Understand my data"** — the real goal; not "run a regression" but "what does this mean?"
- **"Click, not code"** — how we describe the interaction model
- **"One place"** — consolidation, not another tool to add
- **"See it to believe it"** — visualization is how these users think, not a nice-to-have
- **"Built for people who think in questions, not syntax"** — the identity line
- **"The gap"** — the space between having data and understanding it

---

## Language to Avoid

- **Avoid:** "AI-powered" / "intelligent" / "smart" — **Because:** overused, triggers skepticism, and implies the tool thinks for you, which is exactly what users fear ("the biggest risk is that you give up thinking about the questions yourself")
- **Avoid:** "All-in-one platform" — **Because:** John (former CFO) explicitly warned against this. Sets expectations that can't be met.
- **Avoid:** "Easy" / "simple" — **Because:** dismissive of real complexity. Statistics IS hard. The tool should make it accessible, not pretend it's trivial.
- **Avoid:** "No code" / "low code" — **Because:** implies the audience was going to code and chose not to. They were never going to code. It's table stakes, not a selling point.
- **Avoid:** "Empower" / "democratize" / "revolutionize" — **Because:** meaningless startup language. "Empower" is invisible. "Democratize" is patronizing. "Revolutionize" signals vaporware.
- **Avoid:** "Seamless" / "frictionless" / "leverage" / "optimize" — **Because:** corporate jargon that creates distance from the audience. Show the workflow; don't label it.

## Tone Guidelines

- **Direct, not academic** — write like you're explaining something to a smart friend, not submitting to a journal
- **Empathetic, not patronizing** — these people are experts in their fields; they're not stupid, they're just not programmers
- **Honest, not aspirational** — say what the product does, not what it will become; don't oversell
- **Grounded, not abstract** — reference actual pain (coding in Excel, pasting errors into ChatGPT, emailing spreadsheets), not "productivity gains"

---

## Positioning Statement

> **For people who analyze qualitative and mixed-methods data but whose expertise is their work — not programming — [Product] is the web-based analysis platform that gets you from raw data to understood results without writing code, because it handles the methodological plumbing that existing tools assume you already know.**

---

## Brand Values

- **Earn the workflow** — people have survived on duct-taped tool stacks for years. They won't switch for marginal improvement. Every feature must be worth the switching cost, or it shouldn't ship. Inertia is the real competitor.
- **Show the work** — users answer to stakeholders: committees, funders, reviewers, boards. Every output should be auditable, traceable, and explainable. No black boxes.
- **Price for the person, not the institution** — the people who need this most have the least money. Pricing should reflect that.

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I don't have the energy to learn a new tool right now. It's a risk." (TRK2121-01) | You don't have to replace anything. Upload one file, run one analysis. If it's not worth it after that, you've lost five minutes. |
| "I would never pay out of pocket for software." (MA4254-01) | Free tier for individuals. The product earns your money by saving you hours — and you benchmark that against the $10-20/month you already spend on ChatGPT. |
| "Can I trust it? Will my committee / reviewers accept results from this?" | Every analysis shows the method used, the parameters, and the raw output. You can export everything. The tool picks the right test — you verify it. |
| "I already know Excel. It's not great, but I know how it's going to malfunction." (TRK2121-01) | That's the bar. The product needs to be enough better that the switching cost is worth it — not marginally better, but categorically different. Click-to-correlate vs. writing a formula. |

## Key Interview Language

1. **"If I could change anything, it would be have someone else do my data analysis."** — AP4533, undergrad thesis researcher, GREEN signal. The clearest articulation of the core pain.
2. **"I do not have the capacity to figure it out myself, just to copy and paste it again to GPT."** — TRK2121-02, PhD sociology at Columbia. The AI-assisted-but-uncontrollable loop.
3. **"Truly, I'm literally just brute forcing this."** — AP4533. How they describe their current analysis workflow.
4. **"I don't have the energy to think about that right now. It's a risk."** — TRK2121-01, nonprofit research director. The inertia barrier in their own words.
5. **"Oh my gosh, wait, there's a correlate button. Oh, I love that."** — AP4533, reacting to the product demo. The moment it clicked.
