    "price_perception": "fair",
    "strongest_line": "Every result shows the method used, the parameters, the assumptions checked, and what it means in plain language. Auditable. Exportable. Reproducible.",
    "what_feels_off": "The entire copy assumes the goal of research analysis is producing an answer quickly. The problem I have spent my career on is the opposite: slowing researchers down enough that they understand what their answers rest on.",
    "objections": "I've been raising concerns publicly about AI analysis tools and research rigor, and this tool is a cleaner version of the same category. The copy's transparency claims are stronger than most \u2014 I'll give it that. But my objection isn't to a particular tool's implementation, it's to what these tools do to research training.",
    "dealbreaker": true,
    "dealbreaker_reason": "I'm not evaluating this for personal use \u2014 I don't need it and wouldn't use it for my own research. My concern is institutional: tools like this, deployed to graduate students before they have methodological foundations, produce researchers who can generate outputs without understanding what those outputs mean.",
    "gut_reaction": "This is a well-written pitch for a tool that makes the part of research that requires the most judgment look like the easiest part.",
    "unanswered_questions": "How does the platform communicate uncertainty about its own method recommendations? Is there any mechanism to prevent users from exporting results they haven't actually reviewed?",
    "price_reaction": "The free tier at three projects is fine for exploration. The $10 Pro tier is a consumer price that signals consumer positioning.",
