## Problem

### The tools weren't built for the way you actually work.

You've spent weeks collecting interviews, coding survey responses, building spreadsheets. Now comes the part that slows everything down: making sense of it all.

Maybe you open Excel, then R, then paste something into ChatGPT and hope for the best. You get an error. You paste the error back in. You wait. You're not sure if the output is right, but you don't know enough to tell.

Or maybe you know exactly what analysis you need — but you're stitching it together across SPSS, Excel, Word, and a shared drive, spending more time moving data between tools than actually understanding it.

Either way, the tools that exist today — NVivo, Atlas.ti, SPSS, R — were built to do one thing well in isolation. Not to take you from raw data to understood results in one place.

## Solution

### From raw data to real answers. One place. Full transparency.

Upload a CSV, a stack of interview transcripts, or survey exports. The platform detects your data types and guides you to the right analysis.

**Click "Correlate"** — it selects Spearman or Pearson based on your data, shows you why it chose that method, and lets you override it.

**Click "Compare groups"** — it runs the right test (t-test, ANOVA, chi-square, or non-parametric alternatives) and shows you what's significant and what isn't.

**Click "Regress"** — build linear or logistic regression models. The platform checks assumptions, flags violations, and explains the output in plain language.

**Click "Code"** — run thematic analysis on interview transcripts. Start with emergent codes or bring your own codebook. See themes, frequencies, and supporting quotes across your entire dataset.

**Click "Visualize"** — see your results immediately. Not as an afterthought — as the primary way you understand what your data is telling you.

Every result shows the method used, the parameters, the assumptions checked, and what it means in plain language. Auditable. Exportable. Reproducible. Ready for your committee, your funder, or your board.

## Who It's For

- **Graduate students** writing a thesis and dreading the analysis chapter — get from raw data to defensible results without learning R
- **Program directors and evaluators** proving an intervention works, on deadline, with data spread across six tools
- **UX and market researchers** synthesizing dozens of interviews into patterns and deliverables
- **Consultants** who need credible analysis without a data team or a week of setup
- **Research methodologists** who want transparent, overridable automation — not a black box
- **Team leads** buying tools for mixed-skill teams who need a shared analysis environment

---

## How It Works

1. **Upload** — drag in your CSV, Excel, SPSS, or interview transcripts
2. **Clean** — map values, fix inconsistencies, handle missing data with point-and-click tools
3. **Analyze** — click the question you want to answer; the platform picks the right method and shows you why
4. **Visualize** — see correlations, distributions, regressions, and themes instantly
5. **Export** — charts, tables, and full audit trails ready for papers, reports, or presentations

## Pricing

**Free** — 3 projects, core analysis features, unlimited exports

**Pro — $10/month** — unlimited projects, advanced visualizations, collaboration, priority support

**Team — $25/month** — everything in Pro plus shared workspaces, inter-rater reliability, and role-based permissions

## Your Data Stays Yours

Your uploaded data is encrypted in transit and at rest. It is never used to train models. You control who has access, and you can delete your data at any time.

We're pursuing SOC 2 Type II certification. If your organization requires a security review, DPA, or BAA before procurement, contact us — we'll walk through it with you.

## Objection Handling

**"I already use Excel."**
So does everyone. This isn't a replacement for Excel — it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.

**"Can I trust the results?"**
Every analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, what assumptions were checked, and what the output means. Results are deterministic — same data, same output, every time. You can inspect every decision, override any method, and export the full audit trail.

**"I need to see the methodology."**
The platform documents every statistical decision: which test was selected, why, what alternatives were considered, and what would change if you chose differently. You can override any automated choice. This is transparent automation, not a black box.

**"My team uses multiple tools already."**
That's the problem we built this to solve. Import from CSV, Excel, SPSS, Qualtrics, and Google Forms. Export to formats your existing workflow expects. The goal is to consolidate the analysis step — not to replace every tool you use, but to stop being the human translation layer between them.

**"I don't have budget for another tool."**
The free tier has no time limit. If you're spending $10-20/month on ChatGPT to debug R code, this replaces that.
