# Changes from V1

## Summary

V1 resonated with early adopters (thesis_dreader 67% res, ai_loop_prisoner 83% res) but flatlined with professional segments (duct_tape_analyst 0% conv, budget_gatekeeper 0% conv, skeptical_methodologist 0% conv / 75% dealbreaker). The core issues: the copy frames the user as someone who doesn't know statistics, showcases only intro-level methods, says nothing about security/compliance, and presents auto-selection as opacity rather than transparency.

V2 targets the three professional segments while preserving what works for early adopters.

---

- **Section:** Problem
  **Change:** Replaced "You're not a data person. That's not the problem." with "The tools weren't built for the way you actually work."
  **Why:** "You're not a data person" alienated duct_tape_analysts, budget_gatekeepers, and skeptical_methodologists who ARE data people. 25+ personas flagged this framing as condescending or misaligned. New framing acknowledges competence and targets the tool gap instead.

- **Section:** Problem (body)
  **Change:** Added a second paragraph acknowledging experienced analysts with entrenched multi-tool workflows, not just people who are lost.
  **Why:** Duct_tape_analysts (25% res) said the copy "doesn't describe my problem" — their issue isn't incompetence, it's fragmentation across 4-6 tools. The copy now addresses both novice and experienced pain points.

- **Section:** Solution
  **Change:** Replaced "You don't need to know which" with "The platform selects the method, shows you why it was chosen, and lets you override it." Added regression, thematic coding, and mixed-methods mentions alongside existing chi-square/t-test/ANOVA.
  **Why:** Skeptical_methodologists (0% across all dimensions, 75% dealbreaker) saw "you don't need to know" as epistemologically dangerous. 9/12 cited auto-selection opacity as their dealbreaker. The new framing positions automation as transparent + overridable. Adding advanced methods signals the ceiling is higher than intro stats — the #1 objection from thesis_dreader and ai_loop_prisoner personas who wanted to convert but worried about capability.

- **Section:** Solution (new: qualitative analysis specifics)
  **Change:** Added "Click 'Code'" action describing thematic coding of interview transcripts with emergent and a priori code support.
  **Why:** The copy mentions "interview transcripts" but never explains what happens to them. 10+ personas across thesis_dreader, duct_tape_analyst, and ai_loop_prisoner asked "what does it actually do with qualitative data?"

- **Section:** Who It's For
  **Change:** Rewrote to include experienced analysts and team leads, not just people who feel lost. Added "Research methodologists" and "Team leads" entries. Removed "anyone who shouldn't need a statistics degree."
  **Why:** The V1 list exclusively addressed novice anxiety. Budget_gatekeepers (17% res) and duct_tape_analysts (25% res) didn't see themselves. Skeptical_methodologists saw the list as proof the tool wasn't for them.

- **Section:** New — "Your Data Stays Yours"
  **Change:** Added a trust/security section between Pricing and Objection Handling.
  **Why:** 6/12 budget_gatekeeper dealbreakers cited missing compliance/security info (FERPA, HIPAA, SOC 2, data residency). This was the single most common hard blocker for institutional buyers. Even placeholder language about encryption and data handling addresses the gap.

- **Section:** Objection Handling
  **Change:** Added "I need to see the methodology" objection addressing skeptical_methodologists directly. Reworded "Can I trust the results?" to emphasize overridability and reproducibility.
  **Why:** The V1 trust objection ("No black boxes") was too vague for methodologists who want deterministic reproducibility and the ability to inspect/override every decision. The new language specifically addresses their concern.

- **Section:** Objection Handling
  **Change:** Added "My team uses multiple tools already" objection for duct_tape_analysts.
  **Why:** 4/12 duct_tape_analyst dealbreakers cited integration/migration concerns. The copy now acknowledges the multi-tool reality and positions the platform as a consolidation point, not a sixth tool.
