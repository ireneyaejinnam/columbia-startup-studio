## Problem

### You're not a data person. That's not the problem.

You've spent weeks collecting interviews, coding survey responses, building spreadsheets. Now comes the part you dread: making sense of it all.

So you open Excel. Then Word. Then R — or maybe you paste something into ChatGPT and hope for the best. You get an error. You paste the error back in. You wait. You're not sure if the output is right, but you don't know enough to tell.

Sound familiar?

You're not alone. The tools that exist today — NVivo, Atlas.ti, SPSS — were built for methodologists with institutional budgets and years of training. Not for you.

## Solution

### From raw data to real answers. One place. One click.

Upload a CSV, a stack of interview transcripts, or survey exports. The platform detects your data types and guides you to the right analysis.

**Click "Correlate"** — it picks Spearman or Pearson based on your data. You don't need to know which.

**Click "Compare groups"** — it runs the right test (chi-square, t-test, ANOVA) and shows you what's significant.

**Click "Visualize"** — see your results immediately. Not as an afterthought — as the primary way you understand what your data is telling you.

Every result shows the method used, the parameters, and what it means in plain language. Auditable. Exportable. Ready for your committee, your funder, or your board.

## Who It's For

- **Graduate students** writing a thesis and dreading the analysis chapter
- **Nonprofit program directors** proving an intervention works with limited time and budget
- **UX designers** synthesizing 30 user interviews into actionable patterns
- **Consultants** making sense of client feedback without a data team
- **Anyone** who collects qualitative data as part of work they care about — and shouldn't need a statistics degree to understand it

## How It Works

1. **Upload** — drag in your CSV, Excel file, or interview transcripts
2. **Clean** — map values, fix inconsistencies, handle missing data with point-and-click tools
3. **Analyze** — click the question you want to answer; the platform picks the right method
4. **Visualize** — see correlations, distributions, and patterns instantly
5. **Export** — charts, tables, and full audit trails ready for papers, reports, or presentations

## Objection Handling

**"I already use Excel."**
So does everyone. This isn't a replacement for Excel — it's what you open *after* Excel, when you need to actually understand what's in your spreadsheet.

**"Can I trust the results?"**
Every analysis shows exactly what method was used, why it was chosen, and what the output means. You can export the full audit trail. No black boxes.

**"I don't have budget for another tool."**
The free tier has no time limit. If you're spending $10-20/month on ChatGPT to debug R code, this replaces that.
