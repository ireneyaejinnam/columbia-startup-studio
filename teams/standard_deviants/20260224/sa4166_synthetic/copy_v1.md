# Section 1: Hero

## Headline
Stop the manual grind. Start finding the answers.

## Sub-headline
Data work shouldn't feel like a house of cards. CleanSheet turns scattered spreadsheets and legacy scripts into a single, indestructible timeline of logic. No "Version Hell," no untraceable errors—just results you can actually defend.

# Section 2: How It Works

## The Pre-flight Map
Don’t touch a cell until you know the health of your data. The second you upload, we scan for inconsistencies and formatting gaps. If it’s clean, we automatically highlight the patterns that actually matter so you hit the ground running.

## The Polyglot Logic Engine
Stop moving data between folders. Paste your Python, MATLAB, or R scripts directly into the flow. We deconstruct complex code into visual "Logic Blocks" that you can toggle, audit, and plug-and-play without breaking the engine.

## The Permanent Timeline
Every change has a "Receipt." We track every decision, edit, and calculation in a navigable history. "Time travel" back to any version of your project instantly. No more "Final_v2"—just one project with a perfect memory.

# Section 3: Social Proof (The Voice of the Peer)

> “I’m the only person on earth who knows what to do because I’m the only one who wrote the script. If I leave, the workflow dies. This finally centralizes our logic.”  
> — Researcher, USC Brain and Music Lab

> “We used to teach manual calculations as the standard because the software was too intimidating. This bridges the gap for my team without losing the precision we need.”  
> — Director, Settlement Housing Fund

> “In genomic research, you can’t trust a black box. I need to see the code behind the curve. This gives me the automation I want with the transparency I require.”  
> — Genetic Researcher, Cancer Studies

# Section 4: Objection Handling

## "I can’t risk a tool making executive decisions about my data."
We don't. We provide the map; you make the turns. Every automated fix is a suggestion that requires your sign-off. You keep the methodological control; we just handle the heavy lifting.

## "Our current system is messy, but we know how it's broken."
Messy systems rely on "tribal knowledge" and memory. We turn that mental burden into a visual history. When the person who wrote the original code moves on, the project remains readable and reproducible for the whole team.

## "I don't have the capacity to learn another complex tool."
If you can use a search bar, you can use this. We pay the "Transparency Tax" for you by automatically generating the documentation and explanations for your methods as you work.
