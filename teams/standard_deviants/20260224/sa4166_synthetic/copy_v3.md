# Section 1: Hero

## Headline
Every change has a "Receipt." Every decision has a trail.

## Sub-headline
CleanSheet turns scattered spreadsheets, legacy code, and mixed-language analysis into one auditable workspace your team can actually hand off.

Upload a zip file of Excel, CSV, Python, R, MATLAB, and SQL files — we map dependencies, surface data issues, and organize the workflow without forcing rewrites.

# Section 2: What You See in 5 Minutes (Proof)

## 1) Workflow Map
A visual map of how your files and scripts connect, including cross-language dependencies.

## 2) Data Health Report
Auto-detected issues: missing values, schema mismatches, broken references, and suspicious outliers.

## 3) Change Receipt Timeline
Every edit gets logged with what changed, who changed it, and why.

## 4) Audit Export
Generate a reviewer-ready export showing your full analysis trail from raw input to final output.

# Section 3: How It Works

## Step 1: Upload your existing mess as-is
Drop in a folder or zip. CleanSheet ingests spreadsheets, CSVs, scripts, and notebooks in one pass.

## Step 2: We organize the logic and data flow
CleanSheet maps file relationships and code paths into a readable visual flow so teams can understand inherited workflows quickly.

## Step 3: You review and approve suggestions
Automated suggestions never auto-apply. You approve every material change before it lands.

## Step 4: Share, hand off, and defend results
When someone new joins, they can navigate the logic history instead of reverse-engineering filenames and tribal knowledge.

# Section 4: Social Proof

> "I maintain monthly reporting across Excel and SQL plus inherited Python scripts. The first upload showed exactly where our process was fragile. We fixed handoff risk in one sprint."  
> — Operations Analyst, Regional Healthcare Network

> "I stopped losing days validating AI-generated code because I could trace each transformation step and sign off with confidence."  
> — Data Analyst, Growth Startup

> "Grant reporting got easier because we could export a clean audit trail with method notes and decision history."  
> — Research Director, Public Health Nonprofit

# Section 7: Objection Handling

## "Does this replace Excel or my current stack?"
No. CleanSheet layers on top of what you already use. You can keep your stack and gain traceability.

## "Can I trust automated suggestions?"
Only approved suggestions are applied. You remain the decision-maker.

## "Will this take months to adopt?"
Most teams import an existing workflow on day one and complete first handoff documentation in the first week.

## "What if I need methodological detail?"
Use the Methods + Validation notes for technical reviewers, including assumptions and transformation logic.
