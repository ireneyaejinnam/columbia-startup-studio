# Section 1: Hero

## Headline
Every change has a "Receipt." Every decision has a trail.

## Sub-headline
When the person who built the workflow leaves, the workflow dies. CleanSheet puts your spreadsheets, scripts, and analyses on one timeline with a paper trail that anyone on the team can follow.

Works with Excel, Google Sheets, Python, R, MATLAB, and SQL. You can upload a zip of your existing project — we'll sort out the dependencies.

# Section 2: What You See in the First Five Minutes

**A map of your project** — Which files depend on which. Where the data flows. What's connected and what's orphaned.

**A health check** — Missing values, broken references, schema mismatches, suspicious outliers. Flagged for you to review, not auto-fixed.

**A change log from this point forward** — Every edit you make gets recorded: what changed, who changed it, when, and what it replaced.

# Section 3: How It Works

## Step 1: Upload your files as-is.
Drop in your Excel workbooks, CSVs, scripts, or a zip of the whole project folder. CleanSheet reads the files, checks for broken references and formatting issues, and shows you what you're working with before you change anything.

## Step 2: See how everything connects.
CleanSheet maps out which files feed into which, even across languages. If the original project was built by three people in Python, R, and Excel over four years, you'll see the dependency chain laid out instead of reverse-engineering it from filenames.

## Step 3: Work. Everything gets logged.
Every edit, every formula change, every decision gets recorded with a timestamp and a reason. When someone asks "why did this number change?" you pull up the log instead of trying to remember.

# Section 4: Social Proof

> "We had twelve monthly reports built by three different people, and honestly nobody fully understood how they all fit together. The first thing I did was upload the whole folder. Being able to see which formulas fed into which reports — that alone was worth it."
> — Operations Analyst, Regional Healthcare System

> "I kept getting AI-generated code from my team that I couldn't verify. I didn't trust it, but I also didn't have time to trace every function. Now I can at least see what each step is doing before I sign off."
> — Data Analyst, Growth-Stage Startup

> "Our grant committee wanted to see how we got from raw survey data to the findings in our report. We exported the full trail and that was basically it. They stopped asking questions."
> — Research Director, Public Health Nonprofit

# Section 5: Objection Handling

## "I can't risk a tool making decisions about my data."
It doesn't make decisions. Every suggestion needs your sign-off before it touches anything. If you don't approve it, nothing changes.

## "Our system is messy, but at least we know where things break."
That knowledge lives in someone's head. When they leave, the project becomes guesswork. CleanSheet writes down the logic, the dependencies, and the reasoning — so the next person isn't starting from scratch.

## "I don't have time to learn another tool."
You're not migrating to a new system. You upload your existing files and CleanSheet adds a tracking and documentation layer on top. Your files stay your files.

# Section 6: Security & Governance

- Role-based access — control who can view, edit, or approve changes
- Change history with approver visibility — see who signed off on what
- Exportable audit trail — reviewer-ready documentation for compliance, peer review, or grant reporting
- Institutional onboarding — migration support and setup assistance for teams
