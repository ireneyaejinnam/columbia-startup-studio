# Section 1: Hero

## Headline
Every change has a "Receipt." Every decision has a trail.

## Sub-headline
Data work breaks when key people leave. CleanSheet turns your scattered spreadsheets, inherited scripts, and ad-hoc analyses into a single workspace with a permanent, auditable history — so anyone can pick it up, and no one has to start from scratch.

Works with Excel, Google Sheets, Python, R, MATLAB, SQL, and more — including mixed-language legacy codebases. Upload a zip file and we'll make sense of it.

# Section 2: How It Works

## Step 1: Upload anything. Get a health check instantly.
Drop in your Excel workbooks, CSV files, or scripts. Before you touch a cell, CleanSheet scans for inconsistencies, broken references, and formatting gaps — and flags the patterns that actually matter. You see what you're working with before you make a single change.

## Step 2: Drop in your code and data — mixed languages, legacy files, all of it.
Upload a zip file containing your Python scripts, R code, MATLAB files, Excel workbooks, CSVs, or any combination. CleanSheet parses the whole thing, maps dependencies between files, and organizes the logic into a connected visual flow — even when the original code spans multiple languages or was written by three different people over four years.

No rewrites. No migrations. No manual untangling. Bring your work exactly as it is.

## Step 3: Every change gets logged automatically.
From here on, every edit, calculation, and decision is tracked in a navigable history. Go back to any version of your project instantly. Share your methodology with a reviewer and show exactly what happened, why, and in what order.

No more "Final_v2_FINAL." Just one project with a complete memory.

# Section 3: Social Proof (The Voice of the Peer)

> "I maintain twelve monthly reports that were built by three different people before me. Now when something breaks, I can see exactly which formula changed and when — instead of spending two days hunting through files."  
> — Operations Analyst, Regional Healthcare System

> "I was spending a day every week just validating AI-generated code. I couldn't trust it until I understood it. CleanSheet made the logic readable so I could actually sign off on it."  
> — Data Analyst, Growth-Stage Startup

> "We needed to show our grant committee that our analysis was reproducible and auditable. This gave us the paper trail. The institutional license covered our whole research team and paid for itself in reporting time."  
> — Research Director, Public Health Nonprofit

# Section 4: Objection Handling

## "I can't risk a tool making decisions about my data."
It doesn't. Every automated suggestion requires your sign-off before anything changes. You keep full methodological control — CleanSheet handles the documentation and logging so you don't have to.

## "Our system is messy, but we know how it's broken."
That institutional knowledge is the risk. When the person who built the workflow moves on, the project should stay readable. CleanSheet turns what lives in someone's head into a documented, visual history — so the team can run it, not just the original author.

## "I don't have time to learn another tool."
CleanSheet connects to the files you already have. You don't migrate to a new system — you bring your existing workbooks and scripts in, and we add the audit layer on top. Most teams are up and running in an afternoon.
