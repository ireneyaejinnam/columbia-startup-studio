## Changes from V2 → V4 (V3 skipped as regression)

V3 tested a waitlist/free-trial-only pricing model that regressed resonance (-15pp) and intent (-9pp) vs V2. V4 starts from V2 as the base, incorporates V3's structural additions (proof section, security block), and rewrites AI-flagged language throughout.

---

- **Section:** Hero sub-headline
  **Change:** Rewrote from "CleanSheet turns your scattered spreadsheets, inherited scripts, and ad-hoc analyses into a single workspace with a permanent, auditable history" → "CleanSheet puts your spreadsheets, scripts, and analyses on one timeline with a paper trail that anyone on the team can follow."
  **Why:** The "turns X into Y with adjective, adjective noun" structure was flagged as AI-generated in V1 and V2 qualitative feedback. Also shortened — V2 sub-headline was 50+ words.

- **Section:** New — "What You See in the First Five Minutes" (proof block)
  **Change:** Added proof section between hero and How It Works. Lists: project map, health check, change log.
  **Why:** V2 feedback consistently requested concrete proof artifacts. V3 added this section but descriptions were still abstract. V4 uses short, specific descriptions of what each artifact actually shows.

- **Section:** How It Works
  **Change:** Collapsed V2's overlapping Steps 1 and 2 (both were "upload files"). Restructured as: (1) Upload, (2) See connections, (3) Work with logging. Removed "flags the patterns that actually matter" and "connected visual flow" — replaced with specifics.
  **Why:** V2 Steps 1 and 2 both started with uploading, which read as redundant. "Flags the patterns that actually matter" was empty confidence language. "Connected visual flow" was vague.

- **Section:** How It Works — removed staccato pattern
  **Change:** "No rewrites. No migrations. No manual untangling." removed entirely. The migration concern is now addressed in Step 2 context and the objection handling section.
  **Why:** Three-word staccato fragment pattern is the most recognizable AI copywriting tell. The underlying message (no forced migration) is preserved but delivered in context.

- **Section:** Social proof
  **Change:** Rewrote all three testimonials to be longer, messier, and more specific. Added hedging language ("honestly nobody fully understood"), specific details ("twelve monthly reports"), and human phrasing ("that was basically it").
  **Why:** V2 testimonials hit every talking point too neatly — a pattern that reads as fabricated. Real testimonials focus on one specific moment and include filler language.

- **Section:** Objection handling
  **Change:** Rewrote all three responses. Removed "You keep full methodological control" and "CleanSheet handles the documentation and logging so you don't have to." Removed "documented, visual history."
  **Why:** "Full methodological control" is corporate language nobody uses. "Documented, visual history" is stacked adjectives. Replaced with shorter, plainer statements.

- **Section:** New — Security & Governance
  **Change:** Added from V3 in bullet format. Kept brief.
  **Why:** Budget_gatekeeper consistently raised compliance/security as a blocker across V1-V3. This doesn't solve it fully (they need SOC 2 docs, pilot programs) but acknowledges the concern on-page.

- **Section:** Pricing
  **Change:** Restored V2's transparent pricing. Removed V3's waitlist-only model.
  **Why:** V3 data: removing visible pricing collapsed budget_gatekeeper from 50% to 0% resonance. "I can't budget what I can't price." Transparent pricing is a prerequisite for this segment.

- **Section:** CTA body
  **Change:** "Join the teams using CleanSheet to turn fragile, person-dependent workflows into something the whole organization can run, audit, and trust" → "Your workflows shouldn't depend on one person's memory. Try CleanSheet and see your project mapped, logged, and ready to hand off."
  **Why:** Original was the "turn X into Y that can A, B, and C" AI pattern with a triple verb ending.

## What was preserved from V2

- Hero headline ("Every change has a Receipt") — highest-testing line across all rounds
- "Data work breaks when key people leave" pain framing — strong in V1 and V2
- "built by three different people over four years" — level of specificity that reads human
- "No more Final_v2_FINAL" removed (was in V2 Step 3) — good line but didn't fit the rewritten Step 3 flow. May reintroduce if V4 results show a clarity dip.
- Three-tier pricing structure and price points
- Free trial mention
- Objection topics (same three concerns, rewritten responses)

## What was deferred

- Product screenshot / UI demo — still the #1 "show don't tell" request. Requires design asset.
- Student pricing for social_science_thesis_dreader — pricing policy decision
- Methodology whitepaper link for skeptical_quant_methodologist — needs dedicated page
- SOC 2 / compliance certification for budget_gatekeeper — requires legal/compliance
