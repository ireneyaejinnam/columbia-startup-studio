# CleanSheet V2 Synthetic Eval — Summary
**Round:** 20260224.01 | **Version:** V2 | **n=60** | **Date:** 2026-02-24

## Top-line outcome

V2 fixed the **credibility/jargon problem** from V1 and materially improved audience trust signals.

- **Resonance agree+**: **0% → 52%** (+52)
- **Intent agree+**: **0% → 42%** (+42)
- **Conversion confidence agree+**: **0% → 0%** (flat)
- **Dealbreaker rate**: **98% → 50%** (-48)

Interpretation: people now **believe the message more**, but still do not feel ready to buy from this page alone.

## BL → V1 → V2 progression

| Metric | Baseline | V1 | V2 |

| Price fair | 0% | 42% | **58%** |
| Transparency trust (avg /5) | 1.38 | 1.90 | **2.38** |
| Manual friction relief = partial/yes | 0% | 53% | **85% partial** |

Clarity remained stable and solid in V2:
- **nailed_it:** 9
- **partial:** 51
- **wrong:** 0

## What improved in V2 (and why)

1. **Jargon collapse eliminated**
   - `Polyglot Logic Engine`: **mentioned 0 times** in V2 objections/off-comments (down from dominant theme in V1)
   - `Transparency Tax`: **mentioned 0 times**
   - This single change removed the largest trust-killer from V1.

2. **Concrete onboarding improved believability**
   - Explicit support language (`Excel`, mixed-language code, legacy files, zip upload) reduced ambiguity around migration and implementation.
   - `Excel` and `legacy` still appear often in objections (**26 mentions each**) but now mostly as diligence questions, not immediate rejection.

3. **Proof language moved from abstract to operational**
   - Top-selected lines are now practical and workflow-specific, not metaphor-heavy.

Top strongest lines in V2:
- **[15x]** "I was spending a day every week just validating AI-generated code..."
- **[9x]** "That institutional knowledge is the risk..."
- **[6x]** "I trust workflows that show their work, not ones that hide it."

## Why conversion is still 0%

The audience moved from **"I don't trust this"** to **"I might trust this, but I still can't commit."**

Recurring blockers now:
- Missing concrete **proof artifacts** (screenshots, short demo, sample output)
- Security/compliance and governance details for decision-makers
- Methodological detail depth for skeptical quant users
- Remaining implementation specifics (how long, who does setup, what success looks like week 1)

In short: V2 made the product plausible; it did not make the purchase decision low-risk.

---

## V3 priorities (highest leverage)

1. **Add product proof block above pricing**
   - 1 screenshot + 1 “before/after workflow map” + 1 sample audit trail snippet
2. **Add security/compliance mini-section**
   - data handling, permissions, audit export, institutional readiness
3. **Add implementation clarity block**
   - "Day 1 import → Week 1 handoff" with concrete timeline
4. **Tighten CTA to one path**
   - If trial is available, make trial primary and waitlist secondary
5. **Add quant-method appendix link**
   - one-click technical note for skeptical-method audiences

## Recommendation

Continue iterating. V2 is a strong directional win, but the study has not crossed stopping criteria because **conversion confidence is still 0% agree+**. V3 should focus on **proof, risk reduction, and implementation detail**, not more tone/messaging rewrites.
