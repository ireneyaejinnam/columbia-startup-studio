## Changes from V2

- **Section:** Hero + CTA
  **Change:** Made trial CTA primary and moved walkthrough to secondary.
  **Why:** V2 improved resonance/intent but conversion stayed at 0%; users still needed concrete risk reduction before commitment.

- **Section:** Pricing + CTA
  **Change:** Removed paid tiers for this round and replaced with a waitlist-based free trial model; updated primary CTA to "Join Free Trial Waitlist."
  **Why:** User-directed test pivot to isolate whether payment friction is blocking conversion confidence and to measure response to a lower-commitment entry point.

- **Section:** New proof section ("What You See in 5 Minutes")
  **Change:** Added explicit proof artifacts: workflow map, data health report, change timeline, audit export.
  **Why:** V2 feedback still requested screenshots/demo/proof of operation before purchase confidence.

- **Section:** How it Works
  **Change:** Shifted to concrete import/organize/review/handoff sequence with zip/folder ingestion and multi-language mapping.
  **Why:** V2 still had recurring implementation uncertainty around legacy migration and mixed-language workflows.

- **Section:** Security & Governance (new)
  **Change:** Added role-based access, approval visibility, compliance-oriented exports, and institutional onboarding signals.
  **Why:** Budget gatekeeper and institutional evaluators continued to raise security/compliance adoption blockers.

- **Section:** Objection handling
  **Change:** Replaced general objections with explicit stack compatibility, trust controls, adoption timeline, and methods-depth answers.
  **Why:** Conversion bottleneck in V2 was unresolved risk, not message resonance.

- **Section:** Social proof
  **Change:** Reframed testimonials around implementation outcomes and auditability outcomes.
  **Why:** V2 showed audience fit recovery; V3 emphasizes execution proof and handoff outcomes.
