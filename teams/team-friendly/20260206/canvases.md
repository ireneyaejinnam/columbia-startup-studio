Lean Canvas: Campus Study Match
Problem
Studying alone in campus libraries feels isolating, especially for recent grads or students without a strong peer network.
Hard to find others studying the same subject at the same time for quick collaboration or motivation.
Existing platforms (group chats, forums) are asynchronous and not location-aware.
Customer Segments
Primary: Recent graduates and upper-year students studying on campus.
Secondary: Graduate students, exam-prep students, part-time learners.
Early adopters: Students who regularly study in libraries and prefer collaborative or co-working environments.
Unique Value Proposition
“Never study alone when you don’t want to.”
Instantly see who nearby is studying the same subject right now, and connect for focused, low-pressure study sessions.
Solution
Mobile/web app that shows:
Who is studying nearby (library / campus zones)
What subject/course they’re studying
Time window (e.g., next 1–2 hours)
Opt-in matching for:
Silent co-studying
Quick Q&A
Short group study sessions

Lean Canvas: Museum Exhibit Connect
Problem
International tourists often experience museums alone, especially when traveling solo.
Visitors viewing the same exhibit may want to share reactions or insights but lack a natural way to connect.
Language barriers and social hesitation prevent spontaneous interaction.
Customer Segments

Secondary: Solo travelers, cultural enthusiasts, museum members.
Early adopters: Tech-comfortable tourists visiting iconic, high-traffic museums.

“Experience art together, even when traveling alone.”
Connect instantly with nearby visitors viewing the same exhibit to share perspectives, insights, and cultural context.
Solution

See who else is currently viewing the same exhibit
Opt in to chat, react, or exchange insights
Auto-translate messages across languages
Interaction modes:
Silent reactions (emojis, short comments)
Guided discussion prompts
Temporary group chats tied to the exhibit
Key Metrics
Number of exhibit-based interactions
Engagement rate per exhibit
Average interaction duration
Percentage of repeat users across museum visits
Channels
QR codes at exhibit entrances

Lean Canvas: Bar Network NYC
Problem
Aspiring entrepreneurs and startup-curious professionals often go to bars hoping to network, but don’t know who is open to conversation.
Fear of awkwardness or rejection prevents spontaneous startup or business-related interactions.
Existing networking events are formal, scheduled, and exclude serendipitous connections.
Customer Segments
Primary: Aspiring entrepreneurs, founders, and startup employees in NYC.
Secondary: Investors-in-training, freelancers, creatives interested in startups.
Early adopters: Tech-savvy professionals frequenting bars in startup-heavy neighborhoods (SoHo, Williamsburg, Flatiron).

“Turn any bar into a startup mixer.”
Instantly discover who nearby is open to startup, tech, or networking conversations—no awkward cold starts.

Check in to a bar and signal openness to networking
Select conversation interests (startups, fundraising, hiring, ideas)
See nearby profiles that are open to chatting right now
Features:
Time-bound availability (e.g., next 30–90 minutes)
Icebreaker prompts
Optional anonymity until mutual interest
Key Metrics
Number of active check-ins per venue
Matches or conversations started per night
Retention of weekly active users
Conversion to repeat in-person connections
Channels
