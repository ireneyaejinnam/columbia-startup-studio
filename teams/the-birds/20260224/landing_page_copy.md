## How It Works

**Headline:** Frictionless Hanging Out

Stop coordinating in 5 different group chats. Circle makes it effortless to see what's happening and join in.

**No "Who's Down?" Texts**
Don't spam the group chat just to get left on read. Post an activity and let interested people come to you.

**See Who's Already There**
Know exactly who is going before you commit. See profile cards of attendees instantly.

**Join with One Tap**
Found something you like? One tap to say "I'm in" or "On my way". No awkward explanations needed.
