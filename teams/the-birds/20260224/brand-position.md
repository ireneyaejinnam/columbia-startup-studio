# Brand Position

**Team Name:** The Birds  
**Date:** Feb 2026 — Updated 2026-02-24

**Purpose:** This is an internal document. It captures your brand's thesis, identity, and canonical language so that everything you build — landing page, copy, features, pitch — speaks with one voice. This is not marketing copy. It is a decision reference.

---

## Brand Thesis

> **“I am part of all that I have met” by Lord Tennyson**

---

## Core Product Definition

> **Circle helps Columbia students turn “almost going” into “actually going” by replacing text-based planning with live circles you can join with one tap — and showing who’s going before you show up.**

---

## Existence Statement

> **Circle exists to remove the friction of social initiation and arrival anxiety so students default to going out instead of staying in.**

---

## Target Identity

Circle is for someone who wants to be socially active but doesn’t want to perform, over-text, or chase people down to make it happen.

Specifically:

- **New, solo, or starting over**: you want to do things with people, but you don’t have a default crew (or you’re rebuilding one). You need a way to join without asking, and to arrive with context so it doesn’t feel like a cold approach.
- **Has friends but can’t coordinate**: you already have group chats, but plans die in threads. You want a way to see real intent and join without negotiating.

---

## Canonical Language

- **“Last Friday, You Almost Went Out.”**
- **“I’m Going.”**
- **“See who’s down.”**
- **“One tap. No texting. No asking.”**
- **“Everyone there chose to be there. That’s the whole icebreaker.”**
- **“No threads. No feeds.”**
- **“Live circles.”**
- **“Low-friction plans.”**
- **“Default to going.”**
- **“No feed. No posts. No scrolling.”**

---

## Language to Avoid

- **Avoid:** “Social network” — **Because:** It implies feeds and content.
- **Avoid:** “Community platform” — **Because:** It sounds institutional and slow.
- **Avoid:** “Messaging app” — **Because:** Messaging is what we remove.
- **Avoid:** “Post” — **Because:** Posting feels performative.
- **Avoid:** “Event discovery” — **Because:** Discovery already exists; coordination is missing.
- **Avoid:** “Bring your people” (as a primary framing) — **Because:** It implies Circle is for people with social capital and contradicts “You don’t need to know anyone.”
- **Avoid:** “Invite your group chat” (as a headline/section) — **Because:** It reads like growth-hacking and makes solo/new users feel secondary.
- **Avoid:** Any use of “feed” outside of “No feed.” — **Because:** It creates a trust-breaking contradiction.

## Tone Guidelines

- **Calm, not hype** — This is infrastructure, not excitement.
- **Lightweight, not feature-heavy** — No complexity language.
- **Confident, not aspirational** — We remove friction. We don’t promise belonging.
- **Real-world oriented, not digital-first** — The product lives to disappear into real life.
- **Emotionally specific, not vague** — Use concrete situations (“almost going”) without turning into marketing theatrics.

---

## Positioning Statement

For Columbia students who want to do things in the real world but hate initiating and coordinating, Circle is the live social coordination layer where you can see what’s happening, see who’s going, and join with one tap — so you can show up without asking, negotiating, or performing.

---

## Brand Values

- **Friction over features** — If something adds friction, it doesn’t ship — even if it’s cool.
- **Real life over in-app engagement** — We optimize for students leaving the app quickly.
- **Lightweight commitment** — Everything should feel like one tap, not a decision tree.
- **Inclusion without social capital** — Circle must work for someone new, solo, or rebuilding — not just people with a thriving group chat.
- **Arrive with context** — Visibility (who/where/when) reduces anxiety and makes joining feel safe and normal.

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Your Response |
|-----------|--------------|
| “Why wouldn’t I just use a group chat?” | Group chats require initiation, back-and-forth, and social energy. Circle replaces coordination with visibility. |
| “I don’t want another app.” | This isn’t a feed. It’s a lightweight coordination layer: open it, tap once, then close it. |
| “Would I join strangers?” | You’re not walking into the unknown. You see who’s going before you join (names/photos/mutual connections), and everyone there chose the same plan — that’s the icebreaker. |
| “One tap sounds flaky. What if people don’t show up?” | Circle makes intent visible. You can see who joined, and circles are lightweight by design — the goal is fewer negotiations and more real commitments, without turning plans into a thread. |
| “This only works if my friends are on it.” | Circle works for solo plans too — you don’t need to know anyone. If you *do* want friends on it, sharing is optional and lightweight; it shouldn’t feel like recruiting. |
| “What if nothing’s happening?” | Dense campus + real-time activity = visible momentum. The product feels alive when enough circles exist. |

## Key Interview Language

1. “Last Friday, I almost went out.” — The core pattern: intent without follow-through.
2. “I don’t want to text a bunch of people.” — Strongest recurring friction.
3. “I just want to see who’s down.” — Desire for lightweight visibility.
4. “It’s awkward to ask / show up alone.” — Arrival anxiety + social risk.
5. “This only works if my friends are on it.” — Adoption/trust concern (secondary segment).
6. “One tap feels low-commitment — will people flake?” — Social contract gap.
7. “I end up just staying in.” — Behavioral outcome.
