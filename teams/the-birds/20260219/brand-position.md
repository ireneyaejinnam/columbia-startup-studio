# Brand Position

**Team Name:** The Birds    
**Date:** February 2026

**Purpose:** This is an internal document. It captures your brand's thesis, identity, and canonical language so that everything you build — landing page, copy, features, pitch — speaks with one voice. This is not marketing copy. It is a decision reference.

---

## Brand Thesis

> **“I am part of all that I have met” by Lord Tennyson**

---

## Core Product Definition

> **Circle helps Columbia students coordinate real-world activities instantly by replacing text-based planning with live activity circles.**

---

## Existence Statement

> **Circle exists to remove the friction of social initiation so students default to going out instead of staying in.**

---

## Target Identity

Circle is for someone who wants to be socially active but doesn’t want to perform, over-text, or chase people down to make it happen.

---

## Canonical Language

- **“I’m Going.”**
- **“See who’s down.”**
- **“No threads. No feeds.”**
- **“Live circles.”**
- **“Low-friction plans.”**
- **“Default to going.”**

---

## Language to Avoid

- **Avoid:** “Social network” — **Because:** It implies feeds and content.
- **Avoid:**  “Community platform” — **Because:** It sounds institutional and slow.
- **Avoid:** “Messaging app” — **Because:** Messaging is what we remove.
- **Avoid:** “Post” — **Because:** Posting feels performative.
- **Avoid:** “Event discovery” — **Because:** Discovery already exists; coordination is missing.

---

## Tone Guidelines

- **Calm, not hype** — This is infrastructure, not excitement.
- **Lightweight, not feature-heavy** — No complexity language.
- **Confident, not aspirational** — We remove friction. We don’t promise belonging.
- **Real-world oriented, not digital-first** — The product lives to disappear into real life.

---

## Positioning Statement

For students who want to go out but hate coordinating, Circle is the real-world social coordination layer that replaces texting and group chats with instant, visible commitment because it removes friction instead of adding another feed.

---

## Brand Values

- **Friction over features** — If something adds friction, it doesn’t ship — even if it’s cool.
- **Real life over in-app engagement** — We optimize for students leaving the app quickly.
- **Lightweight commitment** — Everything should feel like one tap, not a decision tree.

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Your Response |
|-----------|--------------|
| “Why wouldn’t I just use a group chat?” | Group chats require initiation, back-and-forth, and social energy. Circle replaces coordination with visibility. |
| “I don’t want another app.” | This isn’t a feed. It’s one action: I’m Going. Then you close it. |
| “Would I join strangers?” | Circles show who’s going before you commit. It lowers risk through visibility. |
| “What if nothing’s happening?” | Dense campus + real-time activity = visible momentum. The product feels alive when enough circles exist. |

---

## Key Interview Language

1. “I don’t want to text a bunch of people.” — Strongest recurring friction.
2. “I just want to see who’s down.” — Desire for lightweight visibility.
3. “It’s awkward to ask.” — Emotional barrier.
4. “I see events too late.” — Timing + coordination gap.
5. “I end up just staying in.” — Behavioral outcome.
