## The Problem

Columbia students say they want to meet new people and go out more, but coordinating plans feels awkward and exhausting.

In their words:

* “I don’t want to text a bunch of people.”  
* “I don’t know who to go with.”  
* “I see events too late.”  
* “I end up just staying in.”

The issue isn’t a lack of things happening, it’s the friction of asking, coordinating, and committing socially. Reaching out individually feels high-effort. Posting feels performative. Messaging strangers feels awkward.

### Who has this problem?

Students at Columbia who want to be more socially active but lack lightweight ways to coordinate in real time.

### How do they currently deal with it?

* Group chats  
* Instagram stories  
* WeChat  
* Texting friends individually  
* Going alone  
* Not going at all

### How painful is it?

It’s not catastrophic, but it’s frequent and behavior-shaping. Students repeatedly say they skip events because coordination feels like “too much effort.” Several described defaulting to scrolling instead of going out.

## The Solution

We are building a real-world social coordination app for Columbia students centered around live activity circles instead of messaging.

A student taps “I’m Going,” selects a location (restaurant, museum, campus event, study session), and a visible circle opens. Others can instantly see who is going and join with one tap. No messaging threads. No posts. No feeds.

This is different because it removes text-based coordination and replaces it with lightweight, visual commitment. Social interaction happens in real life, not in chat.

## Target User

### Demographics

* Age 18–24  
* Undergraduate or graduate student  
* Based at Columbia University in New York City  
* Early life stage, actively building social circles

### Defining behavior

* Goes out 1-3 times per week (food, events, museums, study spots)  
* Uses Instagram and group chats daily  
* Feels friction initiating plans  
* Wants to meet new people beyond their existing friend group

### How they describe the problem

* “I just want to see who’s down.”  
* “I don’t want to DM random people.”  
* “It’s awkward to ask.”  
* “I miss stuff because I find out too late.”

## Why Now

* Students are increasingly fatigued by feed-based social media.  
* There is growing demand for real-life, low-friction connections.  
* Campus environments like Columbia are dense, walkable, and ideal for spontaneous coordination.  
* Students already discover events online but lack a seamless way to coordinate attendance socially.

The infrastructure for discovery exists. The missing layer is frictionless, real-time social joining.

**Key Interview Evidence**  
Strongest Quote

“I don’t want to text a bunch of people.”

​​**Pattern (Came up across 3+ interviews)**

1. **Fragmentation everywhere**

   * Events scattered across emails, organizations, Instagram, and word of mouth  
   * No centralized, simple view  
   * Hard to distinguish social vs career activities

2. **High coordination friction**

   * Texting feels effortful  
   * Group chats are noisy  
   * Social planning requires too many back-and-forth messages

3. **App fatigue**

   * Students don’t want another feed  
   * Prefer simple, calendar-like or frictionless systems  
   * Hesitation toward tools that feel performative or public

## Open Questions

1. Will users join strangers, or only people they slightly know?  
2. Will students join activities without messaging first?  
3. What is the minimum event density needed for this to feel alive?
