# Circle

## Last Friday, You Almost Went Out.

You thought about it. You opened your phone. You looked at your group chat. You considered texting someone.

Then you put your phone down and stayed in.

Circle is how you stop almost-going and start actually going.

## Whether You Have a Crew or You're Looking for One

**Have friends but can't coordinate?**
Stop debating in the group chat. Open Circle, see who's heading out, and join with one tap.

**New, solo, or starting over?**
You don't need to know anyone. Browse open circles — study sessions, dinner groups, museum trips — and join ones that feel right. Everyone there already said yes to the same thing you did.

Both paths work the same way. One tap. No texting. No asking.

## How It Works

**See what's happening right now.**
Open Circle and see live activity around Columbia. A group grabbing ramen on Amsterdam. Four people heading to the MoMA. A study session at Butler. Your roommate going to a campus event.

**Join with one tap.**
See who's in each circle — names, photos, and mutual connections. Decide if it's for you. No messages. No "are you free?" texts.

**Or start your own.**
Heading somewhere? Tap "I'm Going." Your circle appears for friends and Columbia students nearby.

**Then go live your life.**
No feed. No posts. No scrolling. Circle gets you out the door, then gets out of the way.

## What Happens When You Show Up

You're not walking into the unknown.

Before you arrive, you see the activity, location, time, and everyone going — names, photos, how you're connected. When you get there, everyone chose to be there for the same reason you did. That's the whole icebreaker.

No cold approaches. No awkward introductions. Just people doing the same thing in the same place.

## It's Already Happening

Last week, 47 circles formed across campus — at Joe's Coffee, Koronet, Butler, the Hungarian Pastry Shop, and campus event nights.

One group chat of 8 friends used Circle and discovered 12 plans they would have missed. A transfer student joined 3 dinner circles in her first week and met people in every one. A grad student found a weekend museum group without sending a single text.

Undergrads, grad students, MBA candidates, law students. All Columbia.
