# Circle

## Last Friday, You Almost Went Out.

You thought about it. You opened your phone. You looked at your group chat. You considered texting someone. Then you put your phone down and stayed in.

Circle makes the difference between almost going and actually going.

## Whether You Have a Crew or You're Looking for One

**If you have friends but can't coordinate:**
No more 50-message group chat debates. Open Circle, see which of your friends are heading out, and join with one tap.

**If you're new, solo, or starting over:**
You don't need to know anyone. Browse open circles — study sessions, dinner groups, museum trips — and join ones that feel right. Everyone there already said yes to the same thing you did.

## How It Works

**See what's happening.**
Open Circle and see real activity around Columbia right now. A group grabbing ramen on Amsterdam. Four people heading to the MoMA. A study session forming at Butler. Your roommate going to a campus event tonight.

**Join with one tap.**
See who's in each circle — names, photos, mutual connections — and decide if it's for you. No messages. No "are you free?" texts. Just tap.

**Or start your own.**
Heading somewhere? Tap "I'm Going" and your circle appears. Share it with friends, your floor, or all of Columbia. Others see it and join.

**Then go.**
Circle gets you out the door. There's no feed, no posts, no content. You use it, you go, you close it.

## What Actually Happens When You Join

You're not walking into the unknown. Here's what joining a circle looks like:

- You see the activity, the location, and the time
- You see the people going — their names, photos, and how you're connected (same dorm, same class, mutual friends)
- You tap to join. They see you joined.
- You show up. Everyone there chose to be there. That's the whole icebreaker.

No cold approaches. No awkward "who are you?" moments. You're all going to the same place for the same reason.

## Columbia Students Only. Verified.

Every account is verified through a Columbia .edu email. You'll only see other Columbia students.

Last week, 47 circles formed across campus — at Joe's Coffee, Koronet, Butler, the Hungarian Pastry Shop, and campus event nights. Undergrads, grad students, MBA candidates, law students. All Columbia.
