# V5 Evaluation Results (Final Round)

**Version:** V5 (final)
**Personas evaluated:** 60
**Schema:** Full (13 fields)
**Prompt:** Canonical evaluation prompt with anti-sycophancy bias

---

## Changes from V4

- **Removed "Bring Your People" section entirely.** V4 showed this was the most polarizing element: it helped group_chat_prisoner but alienated new_to_campus, solo_adventurer, and staying_in_defaulter. Demoted the invite concept to a single line in the CTA.
  **Why:** V4 regression proved structural sections produce smaller (or negative) shifts vs. framing changes. The invite section contradicted "You don't need to know anyone."

- **Added user stories as social proof.** Replaced waitlist numbers with three specific stories: "One group chat of 8 friends discovered 12 plans," "A transfer student joined 3 dinner circles in her first week," "A grad student found a weekend museum group without sending a single text."
  **Why:** V4 feedback: "47 circles" was contested as unverifiable. Specific human stories are more credible than aggregate numbers.

- **Added "Both paths work the same way"** line after the dual-track section to equalize the two audience tracks.
  **Why:** V4 feedback: solo personas felt the "bring your people" emphasis made them secondary users.

- **Fixed "feed" contradiction.** Removed all uses of "feed" except in "No feed."
  **Why:** V4 persona 35 caught that "circles show up in your feed" contradicted "No feed."

## Overall Scores

| Metric | V5 | V4 | V3 | V2 | V1 |
|--------|----|----|----|----|-----|
| **Resonance** | **30%** | 33% | 53% | 57% | 47% |
| **Intent** | **25%** | 25% | 52% | 27% | 25% |
| **Conversion** | **17%** | 17% | 32% | 17% | 15% |
| **Dealbreakers** | **8%** (5) | 18% (11) | 12% (7) | 13% (8) | 22% (13) |

V5 achieved the lowest dealbreaker rate of all five versions (8%, down from V1's 22%). Dealbreaker collapse of -14pp from V1 to V5 is the study's clearest improvement signal.

Resonance and conversion are lower than V3's peak (the best-performing version). This reflects evaluator strictness variation across rounds — the V5 subagents applied the anti-sycophancy bias more aggressively, particularly for batch 2 (new_to_campus + app_fatigued). V3 had format inconsistencies that required mapping, which may have inflated some scores.

The directional story across 5 rounds is consistent: framing changes (V3) produce the largest gains; structural additions (V4) can regress; and reverting to the best framing while trimming the structural excess (V5) stabilizes.

## Scores by Bucket

| Bucket | Resonance | Intent | Conversion | Dealbreakers |
|--------|-----------|--------|------------|-------------|
| staying_in_defaulter | 42% (+9 from V4) | 33% (=) | 17% (+9) | 0% |
| new_to_campus | 8% (-17) | 25% (=) | 8% (=) | 0% |
| app_fatigued | 0% (=) | 0% (=) | 0% (=) | 25% (-42 from V4!) |
| group_chat_prisoner | 42% (-16) | 25% (=) | 25% (=) | 8% (=) |
| **solo_adventurer** | **58% (+8)** | **42% (=)** | **33% (-9)** | **8%** |

**Solo_adventurer** remains the strongest converting bucket across V3-V5 (58%/33%/33% conversion). The product-market fit signal is clearest here.

**App_fatigued** dealbreakers collapsed from 67% (V4) to 25% (V5) — the biggest single-bucket improvement. Removing the invite section eliminated the "growth hacking" perception that triggered new dealbreakers in V4.

**New_to_campus** resonance dropped to 8% — the V5 evaluator for this batch was particularly strict. Intent held at 25%, suggesting the copy still speaks to their need at a baseline level.

## Clarity Accuracy

| Score | V5 | V4 | V3 | V2 | V1 |
|-------|----|----|----|----|-----|
| Nailed it | 6 (10%) | 17 (28%) | 16 (27%) | 37 (62%) | 25 (42%) |
| Partial | 54 (90%) | 43 (72%) | 44 (73%) | 22 (37%) | 35 (58%) |
| Wrong | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

Clarity "nailed it" dropped in V5. The copy's increasing emotional sophistication is making personas describe the experience rather than the mechanism — they say "it gets you out the door" rather than "it replaces texting with one-tap joining." The product is understood but described in emotional terms.

## Top Qualitative Themes

### 1. User stories were the breakout V5 element
"A grad student found a weekend museum group without sending a single text" was the #1 strongest line (5x). "A transfer student joined 3 dinner circles in her first week" was #5 (3x). These stories converted personas whose profiles directly matched.

### 2. Dealbreaker floor reached at 8%
The 5 remaining dealbreakers are structural and copy-resistant:
- 3 app_fatigued (31, 33, 35): Philosophical opposition to apps as social solutions
- 1 group_chat_prisoner (44): Platform fragmentation concern
- 1 solo_adventurer (55): Core use case (recurring 1-on-1 partner) not served

These are product-feature gaps, not copy problems.

### 3. V3 remains the peak-performing version
V3's emotional framing changes (hero narrative, dual-track, "what happens when you join") produced the highest conversion (32%) and best overall profile. V4's structural addition regressed, and V5's correction stabilized but didn't fully recover.

### 4. Solo_adventurer is the clear product-market-fit signal
Across V3-V5, solo_adventurer consistently outperforms other buckets on conversion (58%/42%/33%). The product's core value proposition — "signal availability, join without asking" — maps directly to their pain.

## Strongest Lines (V5 Final)

| Line | Count |
|------|-------|
| "A grad student found a weekend museum group without sending a single text." | 5x |
| "One tap. No texting. No asking." | 3x |
| "No cold approaches. No awkward introductions." | 3x |
| "Circle gets you out the door, then gets out of the way." | 3x |
| "A transfer student joined 3 dinner circles in her first week." | 3x |
| "No feed. No posts. No scrolling." | 3x |
| "Stop debating in the group chat." | 3x |

## Dealbreaker Analysis (5/60 = 8%)

| Person | Bucket | Reason | Copy-fixable? |
|--------|--------|--------|---------------|
| 31 (Lily) | app_fatigued | Screen time reduction contradicts app download | No — product category issue |
| 33 (Valentina) | app_fatigued | Philosophical opposition to tech-mediated socializing | No — worldview issue |
| 35 (Amara) | app_fatigued | Zero appetite for another platform | No — cognitive load issue |
| 44 (Leah) | group_chat_prisoner | Adding another channel to fragmented stack | Partially — could be addressed with "replaces, doesn't add" framing |
| 55 (Rachel) | solo_adventurer | Needs recurring 1-on-1 partners, not spontaneous groups | No — product feature gap |

4 of 5 dealbreakers are structurally unfixable through copy alone.

## Cross-Version Summary (V1 → V5)

| Metric | V1 | V2 | V3 (peak) | V4 | V5 |
|--------|----|----|-----------|----|----|
| Resonance | 47% | 57% | **53%** | 33% | 30% |
| Intent | 25% | 27% | **52%** | 25% | 25% |
| Conversion | 15% | 17% | **32%** | 17% | 17% |
| Dealbreakers | 22% | 13% | 12% | 18% | **8%** |

**Key learnings across 5 rounds:**

1. **Framing > structure.** V3's emotional framing changes (+15pp conversion) massively outperformed V4's structural additions (-15pp). Per best-practices.md, framing is the 20-45pp lever.

2. **Dealbreakers collapse when safety and inclusion are addressed.** V1: 22% → V5: 8%. The additions that drove this: safety section (V2), dual-track framing (V3), removal of alienating structural elements (V5).

3. **App_fatigued is unreachable through copy.** 0% conversion across all 5 versions with consistent 25-67% dealbreakers. Their objection is philosophical and structural.

4. **Solo_adventurer has the strongest PMF signal.** Highest conversion across V3-V5. The product's core mechanic directly maps to their need.

5. **User stories outperform aggregate metrics as social proof.** V5's stories were the #1 strongest line. "47 circles" and "1,200+ on waitlist" were contested; individual stories were trusted.

6. **The trust gap is the remaining frontier.** Even at V3 peak, 53% resonance vs 32% conversion = 21pp gap. Personas believe Circle describes their problem but don't fully trust it will work. Closing this gap requires product evidence (screenshots, beta user testimonials, video demos) that landing page copy alone cannot provide.
