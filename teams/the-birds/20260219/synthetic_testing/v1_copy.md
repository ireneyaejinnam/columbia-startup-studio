# Circle

## Stop Texting. Start Going.

You want to go out tonight. But first you'd have to text five people, wait for replies, negotiate a time, pick a place, and hope nobody flakes.

So you stay in. Again.

## The Problem

Making plans at Columbia shouldn't feel like project management.

- Group chats where plans go to die
- DMs that go unanswered until it's too late
- Events you find out about after they happened
- Defaulting to Netflix because coordinating is exhausting

You're not antisocial. You're just tired of the overhead.

## How Circle Works

**1. Tap "I'm Going"**
Pick a spot — a restaurant, a museum, a campus event, a study session. One tap opens a live circle.

**2. Others See and Join**
Your circle is visible to other Columbia students nearby. They join with one tap. No messages. No back-and-forth.

**3. You Go**
That's it. No feeds. No threads. No content to scroll. Circle exists to get you out the door, then it gets out of the way.

## No Feeds. No Threads. Just Real Life.

Circle is not a social network. There's nothing to post, nothing to scroll, nothing to like.

It's a coordination layer. You open it when you're ready to go somewhere. You close it when you leave.

## Built for Columbia

Circle is designed for campus life — dense, walkable, and full of things happening. See live circles at Joe's Coffee, the Met, Ferris Booth, or wherever students are heading tonight.
