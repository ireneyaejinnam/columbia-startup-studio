# Circle

## Last Friday, You Almost Went Out.

You thought about it. You opened your phone. You looked at your group chat. You considered texting someone.

Then you put your phone down and stayed in.

Circle is how you stop almost-going and start actually going.

## Whether You Have a Crew or You're Looking for One

**Have friends but can't coordinate?**
Stop debating in the group chat. Open Circle, see who's heading out, and join with one tap. Invite your group chat — when they join Circle, their plans show up for you automatically.

**New, solo, or starting over?**
You don't need to know anyone. Browse open circles — study sessions, dinner groups, museum trips — and join ones that feel right. Everyone there already said yes to the same thing you did.

## How It Works

**See what's happening right now.**
Open Circle and see live activity around Columbia. A group grabbing ramen on Amsterdam. Four people heading to the MoMA. A study session at Butler. Your roommate going to a campus event.

**Join with one tap.**
See who's in each circle — names, photos, and mutual connections. No messages. No "are you free?" texts. Just tap.

**Or start your own.**
Heading somewhere? Tap "I'm Going." Share it with friends, your floor, or all of Columbia.

**Then go live your life.**
No feed. No posts. No scrolling. Circle gets you out the door, then gets out of the way.

## What Happens When You Show Up

You're not walking into the unknown.

Before you arrive, you see the activity, location, time, and the people going — names, photos, how you're connected. When you show up, everyone there chose to be there for the same reason you did. That's the whole icebreaker.

No cold approaches. No awkward introductions. Just people doing the same thing in the same place.

## Bring Your People

Circle works best when your friends are on it.

- **Share your invite link** with your group chat, your floor, or your club
- **When your friends join**, their circles show up in your feed automatically
- **See when they're heading out** — no need to text and ask

The more people you know on Circle, the more plans happen without effort.
