# V2 Evaluation Results

**Version:** V2
**Personas evaluated:** 60 (12 per bucket x 5 buckets)
**Schema:** Full (13 fields)
**Prompt:** Canonical evaluation prompt with anti-sycophancy bias

## Changes from V1

- **Hero:** Changed headline to "You're Not Antisocial. You're Just Tired of the Overhead." (V1's strongest line). Added framing sentence: "Circle is the missing piece between wanting to go and actually going."
  **Why:** V1's #1 resonating line across all buckets. Leads with emotional validation instead of a command.

- **How It Works:** Reframed to emphasize JOINING first ("See who's going"), then creating. Added "See who's already going before you commit."
  **Why:** V1 feedback showed many personas want to browse/join passively, not initiate. The V1 copy centered on "Tap I'm Going" which felt like it required confidence.

- **Columbia section:** Replaced generic "Built for Columbia" with "Columbia Students Only" + specific waitlist number (1,200+) + named locations (Joe's Coffee, Butler Library, Koronet Pizza).
  **Why:** V1 feedback flagged this section as template copy. Added social proof to address #1 objection (cold start fear).

- **NEW: Safety section:** Added Columbia .edu verification, see-who's-in-circle, visibility controls, block/report.
  **Why:** Safety was a dealbreaker for 4 personas in V1 (3 solo_adventurer women + 1 catfishing survivor). Complete absence was a critical gap.

- **Privacy signal:** Added "No data sold. Ever." to CTA section.
  **Why:** Privacy was a dealbreaker for 5 app_fatigued personas in V1.

- **Jargon removal:** Replaced "coordination layer" with "the missing piece between wanting to go and actually going."
  **Why:** 5+ V1 personas flagged "coordination layer" as startup jargon.

## Overall Scores

| Metric | V2 | V1 | Delta |
|--------|----|----|-------|
| **Resonance** | **57%** | 47% | **+10pp** |
| **Intent** | **27%** | 25% | **+2pp** |
| **Conversion** | **17%** | 15% | **+2pp** |
| **Dealbreakers** | **13%** (8) | 22% (13) | **-9pp** |

Resonance gained +10pp. Dealbreakers collapsed from 22% to 13% (5 fewer). Conversion moved only +2pp — the resonance-conversion gap widened from 32pp to 40pp. This confirms a **trust gap**, not a copy quality problem.

## Scores by Bucket

| Bucket | Resonance (V2/V1) | Intent (V2/V1) | Conversion (V2/V1) | Dealbreakers (V2/V1) |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| staying_in_defaulter | 67% / 67% | 33% / 25% (+8) | 17% / 17% | 0% / 8% |
| new_to_campus | 50% / 50% | 33% / 25% (+8) | 25% / 25% | 0% / 8% |
| **group_chat_prisoner** | **92% / 58% (+34)** | 33% / 25% (+8) | 25% / 17% (+8) | 0% / 0% |
| solo_adventurer | 67% / 58% (+9) | 33% / 50% (-17) | 17% / 17% | 17% / 25% (-8) |
| app_fatigued | 8% / 0% (+8) | 0% / 0% | 0% / 0% | 50% / 67% (-17) |

**Biggest winner:** group_chat_prisoner resonance jumped +34pp to 92%. The reframed "How It Works" and "50 messages" language hit directly.

**Surprise:** solo_adventurer intent *dropped* -17pp despite resonance gaining +9pp. The reframing toward group coordination inadvertently distanced solo personas who don't have groups to coordinate with.

## Clarity Accuracy

| Score | V2 | V1 | Delta |
|-------|----|----|-------|
| Nailed it | 37 (62%) | 25 (42%) | +12 |
| Partial | 22 (37%) | 35 (58%) | -13 |
| Wrong | 1 (2%) | 0 (0%) | +1 |

Clarity improved significantly. The reframed "How It Works" section communicates the mechanism more effectively.

## Top Qualitative Themes

### 1. Resonance-conversion gap is now 40pp — trust is the bottleneck
57% resonance vs 17% conversion. The copy accurately names the problem and clearly explains the solution, but personas don't believe it will work in practice. The missing ingredient is evidence: real user stories, screenshots, specific examples of circles that formed.

### 2. "I don't have friends to coordinate with" — unaddressed segment pain
New_to_campus and solo_adventurer personas repeatedly flagged that the copy assumes existing friend groups. The coordination framing ("group chats where plans go to die") alienates people whose problem is loneliness, not logistics. This is a framing problem, not a structural one.

### 3. Adoption fear persists despite social proof
"1,200+ on the waitlist" helped some but backfired with skeptical personas who read it as a vanity metric. The more persuasive signal would be specificity: "Circles are forming in [specific context]" with real examples.

### 4. App_fatigued dealbreakers dropped but conversion is still 0%
Dealbreakers fell from 67% to 50% (privacy/safety additions helped) but the bucket remains structurally unreachable. Their objection is philosophical, not copy-related.

## Strongest Lines (V2)

| Line | Count |
|------|-------|
| "Group chats where plans go to die" | 5x |
| "No messages. No back-and-forth. No awkward 'are you free?' texts." | 4x |
| "Columbia .edu verification required — no anonymous accounts" | 4x |
| "Making plans at Columbia shouldn't require 50 messages." | 3x |
| "See who's going." | 3x |

The safety-related line (.edu verification) entered the top 5 for the first time — validating the V2 addition.

## Dealbreaker Analysis (8/60 = 13%, down from 22%)

| Bucket | V2 | V1 | Change |
|--------|----|----|--------|
| app_fatigued | 6 | 8 | -2 |
| solo_adventurer | 2 | 3 | -1 |
| staying_in_defaulter | 0 | 1 | -1 |
| new_to_campus | 0 | 1 | -1 |
| group_chat_prisoner | 0 | 0 | — |

Dealbreaker collapse of -9pp is significant (per best-practices.md: "reducing dealbreakers from X% to Y% means moving that % from 'never' to 'maybe'"). 5 personas moved from dealbreaker to reachable.

## Recommendations for V3

1. **Add an emotional framing layer for people without friend groups.** The copy currently speaks only to "broken coordination." Add a section or subheading that speaks to "I want to meet people but don't know how" — the new_to_campus and solo_adventurer pain point. Per best-practices.md, framing changes are the highest-leverage variable (20-45pp shifts).

2. **Replace the waitlist number with specificity.** Instead of "1,200+", show "Last week: 47 circles formed at Columbia" or a specific example. Skeptics dismiss round numbers.

3. **Add a "what happens when you join" section.** The copy explains the tap but not the experience. Solo_adventurers and introverts need to know: what does arriving look like? Is it awkward? This is the gap between intent (27%) and conversion (17%).

4. **Add notification control mention.** App_fatigued persona Jaden specifically cited "zero mention of notification controls" as a dealbreaker. One line could help.

5. **Acknowledge grad students explicitly.** Multiple grad student personas feel excluded by undergrad-centric examples.
