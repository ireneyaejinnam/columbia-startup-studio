# Circle

## You're Not Antisocial. You're Just Tired of the Overhead.

You want to go out tonight. But first you'd have to text five people, wait for replies, negotiate a time, pick a place, and hope nobody flakes.

So you stay in. Again.

Circle is the missing piece between wanting to go and actually going.

## The Problem You Already Know

Making plans at Columbia shouldn't require 50 messages.

- Group chats where plans go to die
- DMs that go unanswered until it's too late
- Events you find out about after they happened
- Defaulting to staying in because coordinating is exhausting

Whether you're trying to rally your friends or just want to see who's around — the overhead kills it.

## How It Works

**See who's going.**
Open Circle and see live activity happening around Columbia right now — friends heading to dinner, classmates at a study session, a group going to the Met.

**Join with one tap.**
No messages. No back-and-forth. No awkward "are you free?" texts. Just tap to join. You'll see who's already going before you commit.

**Or start your own.**
Heading somewhere? Tap "I'm Going," pick a spot, and your circle is visible to friends and other Columbia students nearby. Others join you.

**Then close the app.**
Circle exists to get you out the door. No feeds. No threads. No content to scroll. Use it, leave, go live your life.

## Columbia Students Only

Circle is verified through your Columbia email. You'll only see other Columbia students — people you might already recognize from class, your dorm, or campus events.

Right now, **1,200+ Columbia students are on the waitlist.** Circles are already forming at Joe's Coffee, Butler Library, Koronet Pizza, and campus event nights.

## Safe by Design

- **Columbia .edu verification required** — no anonymous accounts
- **See who's in a circle before you join** — names, photos, and mutual connections are visible
- **You choose your visibility** — share circles with friends only, or make them open to all Columbia students
- **Block and report** built in from day one
