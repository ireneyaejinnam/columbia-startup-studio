# Class Schedule - Startup Studio: AI-Accelerated Building & Validation

**Course:** Startup Studio: AI-Accelerated Building & Validation
**Instructors:** Lydia Chilton (Sponsoring Professor) & Ken St. Clair (Adjunct Assistant Professor)
**Semester:** Spring 2026

---

## Course Milestones

The course follows the canonical validation sequence: **Problem → Solution → Demand → Build.** Every major startup framework converges on this order — Lean Startup, Customer Development, The Mom Test, Running Lean. Teams that skip stages or do them out of order build things nobody wants.

### EXPLORE (Weeks 1-2)
> Discover problems worth solving. Meet potential teammates.

- Speed dating with classmates
- Brainstorm problems and personas
- Learn Fermi estimation for market sizing

### FORM (Week 3)
> Lock in your team and problem space.

- Form teams of 4-5
- Divergent+Convergent thinking exercises
- Generate multiple ideas before committing

### PROBLEM + SOLUTION VALIDATION (Week 4)
> Talk to real people. Is this problem real? Does your solution idea resonate?

- Problem interviews — talk to 5+ potential users
- Include solution signal questions at the end of each interview (pitch the concept, gauge reaction, ask for commitments)
- Define your target audience from interview learnings
- **Checkpoint:** Do people have this problem, and does your proposed solution excite them?

### SOLUTION VALIDATION (Weeks 5-6)
> Propose a solution and stress-test it before spending money.

- Synthesize interview data; compare human vs. AI synthesis
- Draft brand position document from synthesis + interviews
- Generate landing page copy from brand position
- Test copy against synthetic user personas (built from real interview data, confidence metrics)
- Build and deploy landing page using the best copy version
- Create style guide (STYLE_GUIDE.md) for visual identity
- Set up analytics for demand tracking
- **Checkpoint:** Does this solution resonate with the people who have the problem?

### DEMAND VALIDATION (Week 6)
> Drive real traffic. Will strangers express interest?

- Drive traffic to landing page (social channels + paid ads)
- Collect waitlist signups / demand signals
- Analyze results, iterate on page as needed
- **Checkpoint:** Will strangers pay attention and sign up?

### BUILD (Weeks 7-8)
> Start building for real. MVP by spring break.

- Build the real product — with AI-accelerated development, basic workflows can ship fast
- For problems you can't solve immediately (marketplace cold-start, algorithm building), use Wizard of Oz or concierge techniques to fake the hard parts
- Run experiment 2 (new channel, pricing test, or social validation)
- **MVP Presentations** before spring break (peer feedback)
- *Spring Break*

### ITERATE + SCALE (Weeks 9-13)
> Keep building. Run experiments. Go deeper with analytics, UX, and growth.

- Post-break check-in and experiment planning
- Run experiments 3 and 4
- Analytics deep dive (AARRR / pirate metrics, Google Analytics / Amplitude)
- Onboarding optimization and user testing on real flows
- Pricing experimentation
- Social media and content strategy
- Y Combinator applications
- **Feature freeze** end of Week 13 (Apr 23)

### MEASURE + PITCH (Weeks 13-14 + Finals)
> Product is frozen. Collect results. Tell your story. Demo Day.

- Final measurement round (usage data, quotes, metrics — product doesn't change)
- Build pitch narrative from experiment results
- Pitch workshop with peer feedback
- **Demo Day: May 12** (Finals period)
